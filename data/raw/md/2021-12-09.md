# 3-2-1: Active patience, focusing on what you can control, and playing a game worth winning

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Think about what you want today and you'll spend your time.

Think about what you want in 5 years and you'll invest your time.”

​II.

“Someone else living a good life does not prevent you from living a good life.

There are many ways to win and plenty of space.”

III.

“You don’t need to catch every break if you’re willing to keep trying.

Every winner has an archive of losses, but each attempt creates the chance for a victory.

You need to be patient, but not passive. Active patience.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and activist **Helen Keller** on the importance of doing ordinary things in an extraordinary way:

“I long to accomplish a great and noble task; but it is my chief duty and joy to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. … The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.”
