“In the gym, if you experience no stimulus your muscles won't grow. If you step under 10,000 pounds your body will break.

Life is similar.

Too much challenge makes life hard, but so does too little.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet and playwright **Oscar Wilde** on being grateful for what you avoid:

“If you don’t get everything you want, think of the things you don’t get that you don’t want.”

​II.

**Cus D’amato**, the legendary boxing trainer of Mike Tyson and other top fighters, on courage:

“I tell my kids, what is the difference between a hero and a coward? What is the difference between being [cowardly] and being brave? No difference. Only what you do. They both feel the same. They both fear dying and getting hurt. The man who is [cowardly] refuses to face up to what he’s got to face. The hero is more disciplined and he fights those feelings off and he does what he has to do. But they both feel the same, the hero and the coward. People who watch you judge you on what you do, not how you feel.”
