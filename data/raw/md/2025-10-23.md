# 3-2-1: On balancing gratitude and ambition, the best things in life, and feeling like you have enough

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Each day, spend some time on two things:

1. working toward something that will pay off years from now
2. appreciating something that is happening right now”

---

​II.

“Do not fear what you can address. What should worry you is not the problem, but if you are resisting addressing it.”

---

III.

“Many of the best things in life are endless.

Being in a great relationship. Staying fit and healthy. Doing work that fulfills you. Being a good parent, coach, or teacher.

Stop worrying about accomplishing these things and instead focus on building a life where you continually practice them.

The important stuff has no finish line.”
