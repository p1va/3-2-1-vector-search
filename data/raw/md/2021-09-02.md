## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Many people wish they started sooner. Almost nobody wishes they started later.”

​II.

“Failure is most useful when you give your best effort.

If you fail with a lackluster effort, you haven't learned much. Perhaps you could have succeeded with a proper focus.

But if your best effort fails, you have learned something valuable: this way doesn't work.”

III.

“Nobody is rooting for you to fail.

You may succeed. You may fail. But, for the most part, nobody cares one way or the other.

This is good. The world is big and you are small, which means you can chase your dreams with little worry for what people think.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and anthropologist **Carlos Castaneda** on mindset:

“The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the same.”

​II.

The poet **Yung Pueblo** on relationships:

“Find a partner who is ready to build with you.

It is not about finding perfection in another person, it is about realizing when you come across an undeniable connection that nourishes your being and matches the type of support you are looking for. Getting lost in the idea of perfection is a hindrance. Being with someone who is committed to going through the ups and downs of life together is truly priceless.

When two people embrace their imperfections and commit to growing into better versions of themselves, it will naturally enhance the happiness they share in the relationship.”
