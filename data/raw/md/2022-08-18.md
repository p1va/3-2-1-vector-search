## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and futurist **Robert Anton Wilson** on the size of a person:

“You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.”

​II.

Aviator and writer **Anne Morrow Lindbergh** on the importance of mixing suffering with reflection:

“I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable. All these and other factors combined, if the circumstances are right, can teach and can lead to rebirth.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It's remarkable how many things can be eliminated from your to-do list.
