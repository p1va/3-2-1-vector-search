## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Double down on what is working best.”

​II.

“It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it.

If you don't want to live the lifestyle, then release yourself from the desire. To crave the result but not the process, is to guarantee disappointment.”

III.

“Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn’t matter how good or how bad it is. You don’t need to set the world on fire with your first try. You just need to prove to yourself that you have what it takes to produce something. There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists who became great by half-finishing their work. Stop debating what you should make and just make something.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and psychoanalyst **Marion Milner** on seeing clearly:

“There seemed to be endless obstacles preventing me from living with my eyes open, but as I gradually followed up clue after clue it seemed that the root cause of them all was fear.”

​II.

Engineer, physician, and astronaut **Mae Jemison** on thinking for yourself:

“Never be limited by other people's limited imaginations. If you adopt their attitudes, then the possibility won't exist because you'll have already shut it out… You can hear other people's wisdom, but you've got to re-evaluate the world for yourself.”
