# 3-2-1: On growing fast vs. growing slow, the value of mastery, and climbing the right mountain

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“A critical quality to develop in life is the willingness to try. You simply must find enough confidence to give it a go. The human mind is fabulous at learning. You will get better at whatever you practice. But before you can develop the skill to succeed, you must find the courage to attempt.”

​II.

“Grow fast, built to crash.

Grow slow, built to last.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Entrepreneur and author **Derek Sivers** on the value of mastering something:

“Mastery is the best goal because the rich can't buy it, the impatient can't rush it, the privileged can't inherit it, and nobody can steal it. You can only earn it through hard work. Mastery is the ultimate status.”
