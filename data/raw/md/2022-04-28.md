## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Just because it didn’t work doesn’t mean it was the wrong choice.

Find a game where the probabilities favor you and keep taking shots.”

Both of those are useful.”

“For me, forgiveness and compassion are always linked: how do we hold people accountable for wrongdoing and yet at the same time remain in touch with their humanity enough to believe in their capacity to be transformed?”
