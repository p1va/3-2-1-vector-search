# 3-2-1: The difference between good and great, how to love yourself, and how to get better at writing

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The difference between good and great is often an extra round of revision.

The person who looks things over a second time will appear smarter or more talented, but actually is just polishing things a bit more.

Take the time to get it right. Revise it one extra time.”

​II.

“One of the best strategies for learning something quickly: corner a nerd.

Find someone who totally geeks out about that topic and ask them every question you can think of.”

III.

“A brief guide to compounding:

If you don’t enjoy something, you won’t stick with it.

If you don’t stick with it, it won’t compound.

Being interested precedes the results.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and social activist **bell hooks** on how to love yourself:

“One of the best guides to how to be self-loving is to give ourselves the love we are often dreaming about receiving from others. There was a time when I felt lousy about my over-forty body, saw myself as too fat, too this, or too that. Yet I fantasized about finding a lover who would give me the gift of being loved as I am.

It is silly, isn't it, that I would dream of someone else offering to me the acceptance and affirmation I was withholding from myself. This was a moment when the maxim “You can never love anybody if you are unable to love yourself” made clear sense. And I add, “Do not expect to receive the love from someone else you do not give yourself.”

​II.

Author **Toni Morrison** on how to get better at writing—or anything, really:

“I thought of myself as like the jazz musician: someone who practices and practices and practices in order to be able to invent and to make his art look effortless and graceful. I was always conscious of the constructed aspect of the writing process, and that art appears natural and elegant only as a result of constant practice and awareness of its formal structures.”
