# 3-2-1: Simple mindset shifts, aligning thoughts and actions, and being contrarian

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Simple mindset shifts:

– I'm not hurt, I'm healing.

– I'm not losing, I'm learning.

– I was not rejected, I was redirected.

Negative things happen. Negative mindsets make them harder.”

​II.

“Over long time frames, simply staying in the game is impressive.

– Health and fitness: Can you stay injury free and not miss workouts?

– Wealth and finance: Can you avoid debt and continue to save?

– Business: Can you maintain cash flow and stay in business?

Longevity is its own form of greatness.”

III.

“Balancing success and failure is a tricky thing.

I'd say 8 or 9 times out of 10, you should be succeeding. Build momentum. Accumulate advantages. Feast on the feeling of success and let it feed your desire to do more.

But 1 or 2 times out of 10, you should be failing. Push yourself and reach beyond your current grasp. Force yourself to try uncomfortable things. Occasionally you will surprise yourself and the rest of the time you will learn.

Win enough to keep progressing. Lose enough to keep learning.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Explorer and travel writer **Freya Stark** on aligning your thoughts and actions:

“There can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do.”

​II.

Entrepreneur and venture capitalist **Paul Graham** on the importance of being at least a little bit contrarian:

“Let's start with a test: Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?

If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that possibly be a coincidence?

Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told.”
