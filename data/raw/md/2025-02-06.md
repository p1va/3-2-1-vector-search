# 3-2-1: On grief and friendship, the value of reputation, and prevailing when you’re in a tight spot

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“When accessing all information is common, paying attention to important information is rare.”

*(*​[​*Share this on X*​​](https://ctt.ac/oh2k2)*)*

---

​II.

“On funerals, loss, grief, friendship, and support:

It's not about knowing what to say. It's about being there when nobody knows what to say. The only thing people need to hear is, “You are not alone.” And that doesn't require words. It just requires your presence.”

III.

“The world is big, but industries are small.

After a few years, everyone comes to know the quality of your work.

Reputation matters.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and abolitionist **Harriet Beecher Stowe** on perseverance:

“When you get into a tight place, and everything goes against you till it seems as if you couldn't hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that's just the place and time that the tide'll turn.”

​II.

Author and poet **Maya Angelou** on persistence:

“My wish for you is that you continue. Continue to be who you are, to astonish a mean world with your acts of kindness. The effect you have on others’ lives is the highest expression of your own.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It's hard to get a great outcome when your resources — time, money, attention — are spread thin. Are you concentrating your energies on a small set of targets?
