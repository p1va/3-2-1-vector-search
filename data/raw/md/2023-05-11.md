# 3-2-1: Making your habits fun, how to host a good party, and tips for prioritizing

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Sometimes all you need for exceptional results is average effort repeated for an above-average amount of time.”

​II.

“Make your habits fun.

This doesn't mean each habit will be the most fun thing in your life, but nearly any habit can be made more fun than it is currently. Ask yourself, “What would it look like if this was fun? What would it look like if meditation or exercise or writing—or whatever—was fun?

Find the most enjoyable version of each habit you do.”

III.

“10 years or 1 hour. Those are the two time frames worth prioritizing.

10 years is shorthand for thinking longer-term than nearly everyone else and doing things that are really ambitious or meaningful. Most of the deeply meaningful things in life require long time horizons: building a business, cultivating a happy marriage, growing a family, getting in the best shape of your life, etc.

How do you work toward the 10-year things? In 1 hour increments. 1 hour is shorthand for doing things that can be accomplished from start to finish in a single session like a good workout, a good writing session, reading a chapter of a book, going on a fun date, etc. The key is that you finish with something accomplished, not with half-work still waiting to be completed.

If you spend 1 hour working toward a 10-year project—and you repeat this day after day—you're going to end up living a lovely life.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Physician and YouTuber **Ali Abdaal** shares a useful bit of advice he received from one of his medical school professors:

“An hour before 9 is worth 2 after 5.”

​II.

Actress and dancer **Joan Crawford** on how to host a good party:

“The best parties are a wild mixture. Take some corporation presidents, add a bearded painter, a professional jockey, your visiting friends from Brussels, a politician, a hairdresser, and a professor of physics, toss them all together, and try to get them to stop talking long enough to eat!

It's especially important to have all age groups. I've never noticed any generation gap. All the younger people I know are bright and attractive and have something to say and they dress like human beings. They love to listen, too. They make wonderful guests.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

What's the one action that moves the needle more than 100 other actions? What's the one choice that renders 1000 other choices irrelevant?

Most things are not worth optimizing. Master the big moves and move quickly and peacefully through the other stuff.
