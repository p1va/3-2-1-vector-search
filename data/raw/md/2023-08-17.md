# 3-2-1: Making small bets, how to do great work, how to support the people you love

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Some things work and some things don't. There is almost always another way to get where you want to go. Don't keep trying to open a locked door.”

​II.

“When nothing is working, explore and make a lot of small bets.

After something starts working, double down on what works best.

When that stops working, explore and make a lot of small bets again.”

“It's not that hard on any given day, but the trick is you can't skip days. Your workouts can be reasonable and still deliver results—if you don't skip days. Your writing sessions can be short and the work will still accumulate—if you don't skip days. As long as you're working, you'll get there.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Entrepreneur and venture capitalist **Paul Graham** on how to do great work:

“It's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.”

​II.

Buddhist monk and author **Thich Nhat Hanh** explains how to support your friends and family when they are suffering:

“Even before you do anything to help, your wholehearted presence already brings some relief, because when we suffer, we have great need for presence of the person we love. If we are suffering and the person we love ignores us, we suffer more. So what you can do—right away—is to manifest your true presence to your beloved and say the mantra with all your mindfulness: “Dear one, I know you are suffering. That is why I am here for you.” And already your loved one will feel better.”
