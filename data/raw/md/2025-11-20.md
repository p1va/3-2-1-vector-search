# 3-2-1: On the best type of risk, three keys to improvement, and the purest form of generosity

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The best type of risks to take are ones where (1) the worst outcome is manageable and (2) the best outcome is life-changing.

Think: Asking someone on a date. Or, investing an amount of money you can afford to lose into a business with high upside.

Look for opportunities where it won't kill you if it goes poorly, but you'd be blown away if it goes well.”

​II.

“Three keys to improvement:

1. Do you start quickly?
2. Do you learn from your mistakes quickly?
3. Do you stay in the game and keep trying?”

---

III.

“If your past achievements didn't make you meaningfully happier, don't expect your future achievements to make you happier.

Remember that thing you so badly wanted? If getting it didn't meaningfully change your long-term happiness, then you shouldn't expect the thing you want right now to change your long-term happiness either.

You are roughly as happy as you decide to be today. And some day, years from now, after you accomplish the thing you've been striving for, you'll have to decide to be happy on that day too.”
