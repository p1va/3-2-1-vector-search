​II.

“The hard way is rarely harder in terms of daily effort, but it is often harder psychologically.

It requires:

– thinking long-term   
– removing limiting beliefs   
– avoiding the lure of status and approval   
– trusting that small things will lead to big things

It’s a mental battle.”

III.

“3 things that help luck:

1. Deconstructing your craft, so you know what good opportunities look like.   
2. Remaining vigilant, so you notice when lucky breaks come your way.   
3. Acting quickly, so you are more likely to seize luck when it arrives.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Madeleine L'Engle,** the award-winning writer and poet who produced more than 60 books during her career, on inspiration:

“Inspiration usually comes during work, rather than before it.”

​II.

Psychiatrist **Elisabeth Kübler-Ross** on finding yourself:

“Learn to get in touch with silence within yourself and know that everything in this life has a purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences; all events are blessings given to us to learn from. There is no need to go to India or anywhere else to find peace. You will find that deep place of silence right in your room, your garden or even your bathtub.”
