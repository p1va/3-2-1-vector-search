# 3-2-1: On the cost of success, the secret of creative work, and the power of walking

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Lucky opportunities are like grains of sand. They drift right past a limp hand, but an active palm can gather whatever is within reach and shape it into a little castle. It is the act of engaging with the material that gives it shape. You have to seize the moment.”

“The rules:

(1) know precisely what you want,

(2) determine the cost of what it will take to get it,

(3) don't bargain over the price.”

“The secret of creative work is to make a lot and publish a little.

Don't underestimate the power of giving yourself permission to create junk. Most of what you create will be mediocre or bad.

But that's okay. You only have to show people the good stuff. Make 100 things, discard 90, and share the 10 best. Create, create, create. Edit, edit, edit.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Theologian and philosopher **Soren Kierkegaard** on the power of walking:

“Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. Even if one were to walk for one's health and it were constantly one station ahead—*I would still say: Walk!*

Besides, it is also apparent that in walking one constantly gets as close to well-being as possible, even if one does not quite reach it—but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Health and salvation can be found only in motion… if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.”

​II.

Psychologist and Nobel Prize winner **Daniel Kahneman** on optimism:

“If you are allowed one wish for your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and are in fact likely to live longer.

Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping our lives. Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders – not average people. They got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They are talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than they acknowledge… the people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Exploration is how you discover what works.

Persistence is how you make the most of what already works.

What does your situation require? More exploration or more persistence?
