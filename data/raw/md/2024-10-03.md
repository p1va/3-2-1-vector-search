# 3-2-1: On the power of going for it, the value of sharing what you know, and how to figure out what you really want

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Focus on your likes, not your wants.

* You may not *want* to exercise, but you *like* how it makes you feel.
* You may not *want* to write, but you *like* the feeling of accomplishment.
* You may not *want* to wake up early, but you *like* the calm beauty of morning.

Wanting is the desire you feel before doing something. Liking is the satisfaction you feel after doing something. Let your likes guide you.”

​II.

“Read, but don't just read. Read the best book you can find.

Write, but don't just write. Write the best idea you can conceive.”

III.

“There are many ways to win in business, but there is one surefire way to lose: run out of money. Entrepreneurship is a game of survival.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Ask yourself this question three times and try to refine and improve your answer each time: What do I really want?
