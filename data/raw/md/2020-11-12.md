# 3-2-1: On simplicity, having good ideas, and acting in the face of fear

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Writing is the antidote to confusion.”

---

II.

“When reading books or listening to podcasts or taking advice, remember that everyone is biased to their personal history.

The world is complex and there is no single path to a success. Look for patterns that are repeated across many successful people, not single stories.”

---

III.

“Beginner = ignorant simplicity

Intermediate = functional complexity

Advanced = profound simplicity”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Seth Godin**on having good ideas:

“People who have trouble coming up with good ideas, if they’re telling you the truth, will tell you they don’t have very many bad ideas. But people who have plenty of good ideas, if they’re telling the truth, will say they have even more bad ideas. So the goal isn’t to get good ideas; the goal is to get bad ideas. Because once you get enough bad ideas, then some good ones have to show up.”

II.

Writer **Audre Lorde**on acting in the face of fear:

“We can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired. For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs … and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of that silence will choke us.”
