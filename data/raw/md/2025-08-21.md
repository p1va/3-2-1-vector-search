# 3-2-1: On peace of mind, the power of focus, and how to learn faster

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Praise others. It will bring them peace of mind.

Do not expect others to praise you. It will bring you peace of mind.”

---

​II.

“We often think that we want an open road and the ability to choose any direction for ourselves. But sometimes, what we need is a tunnel that can reduce our choices and send us in a focused direction.”

---

III.

“The person who learns the most in any classroom is the teacher.

If you really want to learn a topic, then “teach” it. Write a book. Teach a class. Build a product. Start a company.

The act of making something will force you to learn more deeply than reading ever will.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

What looks like consistency and commitment can sometimes be fear in disguise. Are you sticking with it because it still serves you or because it's what you already know?
