# 3-2-1: On finding the best way to do something, how timing shapes communication, and making unreasonable requests

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The beginning is mostly luck. The end is mostly choices.”

---

​II.

“There is always more than one way to do something. Write down as many ways as you can think of to achieve your desired outcome. Then, rank them based on how much time they take, how much money they cost, and how effective you expect them to be. Choose the best.”

---

III.

“Today might be the best chance you have to take action.

The longer you wait, the more deeply embedded you get in your current lifestyle. Your habits solidify. Your beliefs harden. You get comfortable.

It will never be easy, but it may also never be easier than it is right now.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Former lawyer and professional poker player **Cate Hall** on asking for things that feel unreasonable:

“Ask for things. Ask for things that feel unreasonable, to make sure your intuitions about what's reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you're only asking for things you get, you're not aiming high enough.”

​II.

Musician **Nick Cave** on cynicism and hopefulness:

“Cynicism is not a neutral position — and although it asks almost nothing of us, it is highly infectious and unbelievably destructive. In my view, it is the most common and easy of evils. I know this because much of my early life was spent holding the world and the people in it in contempt. It was a position both seductive and indulgent…

Unlike cynicism, hopefulness is hard-earned, makes demands upon us, and can often feel like the most indefensible and lonely place on Earth. Hopefulness is not a neutral position either. It is adversarial. It is the warrior emotion that can lay waste to cynicism. Each redemptive or loving act, as small as you like… keeps the devil down in the hole. It says the world and its inhabitants have value and are worth defending. It says the world is worth believing in. In time, we come to find that it is so.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Timing influences communication.

Talk about potential mistakes before they happen and people start looking for ways to prevent them.

Talk about actual mistakes after they happen and people start looking for reasons to defend their actions.

What do we need to be talking about now, so we can learn the lessons before we need them?
