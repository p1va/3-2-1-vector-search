# 3-2-1: How to get motivated and learn faster, and the power of attention

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Motivation often comes after starting, not before.

Action produces momentum.”

*(*[*Share this on Twitter*](https://ctt.ac/F33LG)*)​*

​II.

“Almost anything in life can be learned faster.

Most people learn passively. They wait for insights to come to them.

But you can speed things up by actively searching for useful ideas.

One strategy is to ask the top people what they do. Make their best practices your baseline.”

III.

“We spend a lot of time talking about everything we have to do.

You have to finish 10 things at work. You have to exercise today. You have to cook dinner for your family.

Now, change one word in each sentence. You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.

You *get* to finish 10 things at work. You *get* to exercise today. You *get* to cook dinner for your family.

The right perspective transforms your burdens into opportunities.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Philosopher **José Ortega y Gasset** on the power of attention:

“Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are.”

​II.

Marine biologist **Rachel Carson** shares her reflections on life after watching the migration of monarch butterflies:

“We talked a little about their migration, their life history. Did they return? We thought not; for most, at least, this was the closing journey of their lives.

But it occurred to me this afternoon, remembering, that it had been a happy spectacle, that we had felt no sadness when we spoke of the fact that there would be no return. And rightly—for when any living thing has come to the end of its life cycle we accept that end as natural.

For the Monarch, that cycle is measured in a known span of months. For ourselves, the measure is something else, the span of which we cannot know. But the thought is the same: when that intangible cycle has run its course it is a natural and not unhappy thing that a life comes to an end.”
