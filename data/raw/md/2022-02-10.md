“Most things are not as difficult as they seem—if you focus each day.

However, giving one topic your full attention for an extended period of time is even harder than it seems.

Over a long timeline, the bottleneck is usually attention not ability.”

“The greatest rewards in life are often delayed. The financial benefits of work and investing. The emotional benefits of marriage and friendship. The psychological benefits of creating something that matters. Meaningful outcomes take a long time to grow and compound.

Furthermore, most pursuits involve other people: coworkers, spouses, children, peers. If you want your results to continue to grow, then you need relationships that last.

One of the essential ingredients for success is being pleasant and trustworthy because it allows whatever you are building—a business, a relationship, a project—to continue. Many relationships disintegrate before the rewards accumulate.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer **Ashley C. Ford** on getting started:

“Your first step is just that: the first of many steps. For so long I would stand still, afraid to move in any direction because I wasn’t sure which was the course I wanted to follow for the rest of my life. Finally, someone explained to me that my first steps did not necessarily determine one path for all my tomorrows. There would be more decisions, and more opportunities to make a shift should I need to do so.”

​II.

Biochemistry professor and science fiction author, **Isaac Asimov,** on the unnoticed good in the world:

“It is important to remember that the viciousness and wrongs of life stick out very plainly but that even at the worst times there is a great deal of goodness, kindness, and day-to-day decency that goes unnoticed and makes no headlines.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Entrepreneur and investor [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1487586705074917376?s=21) says some of the best advice he ever received was, “If you can't figure out what kind of work you like, pay attention to what's easy to concentrate on and gives you energy vs. what makes you tune out and feel tired.”

What is easy for you to concentrate on?
