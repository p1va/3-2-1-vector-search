# 3-2-1: On wealth, learning, and love

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Praise others. It will bring them peace of mind.

Do not expect others to praise you. It will bring you peace of mind.”

II.

“Whenever you see an overnight success, your eyes deceive you.

What you are witnessing is the hour of opportunity unleashing the potential energy of previous choices. It was not one decision, but the accumulated power of all that came before.

The fuse was lit on a loaded cannon.”

III.

“You are richer than 93% of people.

Not in money, but in time. 108 billion people have lived throughout history. 93% of them are dead.

You have what every king and queen, every pharaoh and ruler, every CEO and celebrity of the past would give all their wealth for:

Today.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**John Gardner**, a politician and a recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom, on how to live a meaningful life:

“There's a myth that learning is for young people. But as the proverb says, ‘It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.' The middle years are great, great learning years. Even the years past the middle years. I took on a new job after my 77th birthday – and I'm still learning. Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask ‘What is it trying to teach me?' The lessons aren't always happy ones, but they keep coming.”

II.

The Japanese writer **Haruki Murakami** on love:

“If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.”
