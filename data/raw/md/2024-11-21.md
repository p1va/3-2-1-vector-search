# 3-2-1: The power of limiting your options, the value of eagerness, and what we undervalue

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you're eager to learn—even if you aren't particularly talented—then you can make it a long way despite your shortcomings.

But if you're not eager and curious, you'll find your natural abilities often fall short of what is required.”

“I find the projects I'm most excited to work on are nearly always the projects that have really fantastic people associated with them.”

III.

​”Limiting your options now will expand your opportunities in the long run because you can remain focused enough to master something.​

Keeping your options open now will reduce your opportunities in the long run because you divide your attention and end up doing an average job on seven different things.

Are you falling into the pattern of always mastering one thing or always chasing the next thing?”
