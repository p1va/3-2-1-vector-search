​II.

“Prediction depends on events outside your control.

Creation depends on events within your control.

Don’t guess about the future. Shape it.”

III.

“Three steps to exceptional results:

1) Do less. Stop dividing your attention.

2) Do it right now. Once you have identified the essential, go fast. Maintain a bias toward action.

3) Do it the right way. Acting quickly doesn't mean acting carelessly. Get to work right away, but keep working on it until it's right.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Spanish philosopher **Baltasar Gracian** on how to give advice:

“When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.”

​II.

Writer **Susan Sontag** on persistence:

“It never occurred to me that I couldn’t live the life I wanted to lead. It never occurred to me that I could be stopped…

I had this very simple view: that the reason people who start out with ideals or aspirations don’t do what they dream of doing when they’re young is because they quit.

I thought, well, I won’t quit.”
