# 3-2-1: On your real priorities, living with purpose, and courage

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Optimize for tomorrow—as in, literally, one day from now.

Save to be a little richer tomorrow. Exercise to be a little fitter tomorrow. Read to be a little smarter tomorrow.

1% better every day.”

II.

“Good business advice I received early on:

When someone says no to a request, they usually mean ‘not right now' or ‘not in that way.'

Most people want to help others, but there are many priorities competing for our time.

Don’t take it personally. Ask again later. Ask differently.”

III.

“A principle for writing, investing, and life in general:

It is much easier to notice when something is working than to predict ahead of time if it will work.

Take action, make many small bets, and run lots of quick (but thoughtful) experiments. Then, double-down on the winners.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

NFL head coach **Bill Belichick**, winner of six Super Bowls, on what is at the top of his priority list:

Interviewer: “With all you have accomplished in your coaching career, what is left that you still want to accomplish?”

Belichick: “I'd like to go out and have a good practice today. That would be at the top of the list right now.”
