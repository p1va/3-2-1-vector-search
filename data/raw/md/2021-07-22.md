# 3-2-1: How to find opportunities, finishing what you start, and what it takes to improve

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Not being busy is a competitive advantage.

Most people are so strapped for time they can't take advantage of lucky opportunities or quickly resolve unexpected problems.

Maintain a bias toward action, but leave room for the unexpected.”

“Finishing projects is part of what it means to deliver high quality work. It's not high quality if your perfectionism prevents you from finishing.”

III.

“I can't tell you how many times I don't feel like training and tell myself, “I'll just do one set and see how I feel.”

You would think it would stop working at some point, but I almost always end up doing the whole workout.

Just start. Do a little and see what happens.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and writing teacher **Julia Cameron** on what it takes to improve:

“It is impossible to get better and look good at the same time.

Give yourself permission to be a beginner. By being willing to be a bad artist, you have a chance to be an artist, and perhaps, over time, a very good one.”

​II.

Entrepreneur and investor **Ben Casnocha** on how to find opportunities:

“Every opportunity is attached to a person. Opportunities do not float like clouds in the sky. They’re attached to people.

If you’re looking for an opportunity — including one that has a financial payoff — you’re really looking for a person.”
