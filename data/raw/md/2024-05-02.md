III.

“Simple ways to have a peaceful moment:

* Close your eyes and just breathe for two minutes.
* Leave your phone in another room for an hour.
* Watch a cloud form and then dissolve.
* Stand in the sunshine and notice how it warms your skin.
* Light a candle and watch the flame dance.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Fantasy writer **J.R.R. Tolkien** on being overlooked:

“Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.”

​II.

Novelist **Chuck Palahniuk** on memory:

“It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.”
