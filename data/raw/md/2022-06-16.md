# 3-2-1: Acting your age, financial advice from a grandmother, and forgiveness

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“On the ground, a rock is just a rock. But when moving at high speed through the atmosphere, a rock becomes a meteor—alive with fire and burning bright.

People are not so different. Without activity, we are lifeless and dull. When moving fast and taking action, we come alive.”

​II.

“Life is a series of tradeoffs, and greater results usually require greater tradeoffs.

The question is not, “Do you want to be great at this?”

The question is, “What are you willing to give up in order to be great at this?”

“A surefire way to make a bad situation worse is to continue replaying it in your mind.

The damage is done. The only thing that matters now is making the best choice given your current position.

Next play mentality.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Meditation teacher, **Light Watkins,** on acting your age:

“The advice shouldn't be to act your age. It should be to act your spirit. Your age may try to prohibit you from dancing like that, or starting over, or trying something new. But your spirit would never do such a thing. If something feels aligned, your spirit wants you to go for it, whether you're 15 or 85. Acting your age makes you fit in more, while acting your spirit will indeed cause you to stand out—in a bad way to people who act their age, but in an inspiring way to those who act their spirit. Try acting your spirit from time to time, and you can see for yourself which path makes you feel more alive.”

**Sasha Aickin**, former CTO at Redfin, shares some financial advice from his grandmother:

“When you buy something cheap and bad, the best you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it. When you buy something expensive and good, the worst you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it.”
