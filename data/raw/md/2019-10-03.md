# 3-2-1: On the costs of habits, major life changes, and what money can’t buy

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The costs of your good habits are in the present.

The costs of your bad habits are in the future.”

II.

“Why focus on the process when the world is outcome driven? Don’t results matter?

Yes, results do matter. But if you optimize for the outcome, you win one time.

If you optimize for a process that leads to great outcomes, you can win again and again.”

III.

“Major life changes—moving to a new city, starting a new job, ending a relationship, getting married, having kids, etc.—will often make life harder for the first 100 days before improving.

This is not always true, but it’s a nice reminder that experiencing early struggle doesn’t mean it was a bad choice.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Italian billionaire **Brunello Cucinelli** on what money can’t buy:

“There are three things you cannot buy.

Fitness: You have to keep fit, whether you’re rich or not.

Diet: You cannot pay someone to be on a diet for you.

…

Then, looking after your soul. No one can possibly treat your soul but you yourself.”

II.

The novelist **Jonathan Safran Foer** on changing your habits:

“Instead of imagining all the meals ahead of you, focus on the meal in front of you. Don't give up burgers for the rest of your life. Just order something different one time. It's hard to change lifelong habits, but it's not that hard to change a meal. Over time, those meals become your new habits.”

(Pssst… this quote pairs well with the ideas covered in a little book called [Atomic Habits](https://atomichabits.com).)
