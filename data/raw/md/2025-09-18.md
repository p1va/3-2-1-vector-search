# 3-2-1: On discovering what you love, the importance of apologies, and how to find happiness

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Consistency enlarges ability.”

---

​II.

“If you love them more than the fight, end the fight. An apology loses its warmth if it waits too long. Do it now, before the years turn cold.”

---

III.

“Before you discover what you love: fewer commitments, more experiments.

After you discover what you love: fewer experiments, more commitments.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Art critic and writer **Robert Hughes** reminds us that the closer you get to excellence, the more you notice what is missing:

“The greater the artist, the greater the doubt; perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.”

​II.

Historian and philosopher **Will Durant** on play:

“Let us ask the gods not for possessions, but for things to do; happiness is in making things rather than in consuming them. In Utopia, said Thoreau, each would build his own home; and then song would come back to the heart of man, as it comes to the bird when it builds its nest. If we cannot build our homes, we can at least walk and throw and run; and we should never be so old as merely to watch games instead of playing them. *Let us play* is as good as *Let us pray*, and the results are more assured.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

If you want a plant to grow, you can fuss over it every day—watering, weeding, moving it toward the sun. Or you can place it in the right soil and let nature do most of the work. A seed planted in the right spot often thrives on its own. Life is much the same. Progress is not only about how hard you work, but also about *where* you decide to work.

Where is your energy better spent right now: pushing harder or planting yourself in better ground?
