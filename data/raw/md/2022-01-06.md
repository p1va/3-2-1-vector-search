# 3-2-1: New perspectives, how to improve your thinking, and revising habits

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or an expert as long as you’re on the path.

If a beginner is on the path, all they need is time.

If an expert is off the path, they won’t be an expert for long.”

​II.

“Good advice at the wrong time is bad advice.

Life is full of seasons and each season has different requirements.

Know what season you are in, and you can better identify which ideas to utilize.”

III.

“The longer you're a teacher, the less you remember what it is like to be a student.

The longer you're a doctor, the less you remember what it is like to be a patient.

The longer you're a coach, the less you remember what it is like to be a player.

Change positions. A new perspective can improve your old methods.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Prolific writer **Joyce Carol Oates** on motivation following action:

“One must be pitiless about this matter of “mood.” In a sense, the writing will create the mood. … I have forced my self to begin writing when I've been utterly exhausted, when I've felt my soul as thin as a playing card, when nothing has seemed worth enduring for another five minutes … and somehow the activity of writing changes everything.”

​II.

Writer **David Chapman** on how to improve your thinking:

“Learn from fields very different from your own. They each have ways of thinking that can be useful at surprising times. Just learning to think like an anthropologist, a psychologist, and a philosopher will beneficially stretch your mind.”
