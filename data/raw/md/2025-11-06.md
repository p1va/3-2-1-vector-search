# 3-2-1: How results accumulate, the secret to motivation, and living with a calm persistence

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Results tend to accumulate to the person who enjoys the lifestyle that precedes the result.”

---

​II.

“Earning more money increases freedom.

Spending less than you earn reduces stress.”

---

III.

“Motivation often increases after you begin. The lesson is not to wish you had more motivation, but to make starting as easy as possible.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist and poet **Charlotte Bronte** reminds us to worry less about what's gone or what's coming, and focus more on what inspires us:

“I avoid looking forward or backward, and try to keep looking upward.”

---

​II.

Polymath and writer **Johann Wolfgang von Goethe** reminds us to live and work with a calm persistence:

“Without haste, yet without rest.”

*Note: Goethe's original example was a star orbiting the sun: steady and unhurried, but always in motion.*

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Close your eyes and scan your body. Notice where you are holding tension or stiffness. Breathe deeply and slow down. What is your body asking to do and what does it need right now?
