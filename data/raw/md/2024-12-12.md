# 3-2-1: On acting with confidence, the different types of age, and the importance of momentum

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The key is to enjoy hanging out on the edge. That is, you find it interesting to attempt things one step beyond where you are right now. It could be the edge of your ability or the edge of your knowledge or the edge of your network.

If you reach — but just a little — and you do it every week, then you'll take on challenges that are manageable enough that you win most of the time, but meaningful enough that you improve as well.”

​II.

“Your biological age is the number of days you've lived.

Your psychological age is the number of thoughts you've entertained.

Your sociological age is the number of contributions you've made.”

III.

“Two simple rules:

1. You get better at what you practice.
2. Everything is practice.

Look around and you may be surprised by what people are “practicing” each day. If you consider each moment a repetition, what are most people training for all day long?

Many people are practicing getting mad on social media. Others are practicing the fine art of noticing how they have been wronged. Still more have mastered the craft of making plans (but never following through).

But, of course, it doesn't have to be that way.

What are you practicing?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Entrepreneur **Ben Chestnut** on the importance of momentum:

“Never sacrifice momentum. I might know a better path, but if we've got a lot of momentum, if everyone's united and they're marching together and the path is O.K., just go with the flow. I may eventually nudge them down a new path, but never stop the troops mid march.”
