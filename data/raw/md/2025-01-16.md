## 3 Ideas From Me

“Caring about everything is a disaster.

Caring about nothing is also a disaster.

Nurture the small pocket of things that truly matter to you.”

III.

“People who rarely receive criticism often take feedback too personally and miss opportunities to learn.

People who frequently receive criticism get used to ignoring what others say and also miss opportunities to learn.

The thing to focus on is the pattern. If you hear something once, don't let it wreck your mindset. There are many ways to view the world and not everyone will agree with your approach.

But if you're hearing something repeatedly, think carefully about whether the feedback is right.”
