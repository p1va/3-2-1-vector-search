## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Choosing the priority is as important as working on it.”

​II.

“A surprisingly effective way to get what you want is to not settle for less than what you want.

It doesn't always work—you can't force the world to be a certain way—and you may need healthy doses of patience and doggedness, but your life bends toward what you accept.”

III.

“We need to redefine “hard work” to include “hard thinking.”

The person who outsmarts you is out working you. The person who finds shortcuts is out working you. The person with a better strategy is out working you.

Usually, the hardest work is thinking of a better way to do it.”

Actress **Tallulah Bankhead** on taking action:

“If I had to live my life again, I’d make the same mistakes, only sooner.”

**Thomas Mitchell**, a farmer, on happiness:

“One of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstance…

People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or power to seek and find.

If we are to cultivate the art of living, we should cultivate the art of extracting sweetness and comfort out of everything, as the bee goes from flower to flower in search of honey.”
