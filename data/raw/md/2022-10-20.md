## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Stop learning, die young.

Keep learning, stay young.”

​II.

“One of the great gifts of sports is learning how to fail in public.

People never go to the gym because they're scared of looking stupid, never share their writing because they're scared of judgment, never open their heart because they're scared of rejection.

Sports train you to face your fear.”

III.

“The mind is alive when it is flexible and adaptable. It can be updated, take new form, endure change.

The mind is dead when it is fixed and immovable. It cannot absorb new ideas or thoughts. It is stiff and brittle.

When we lose our ability to adapt, to move with the environment, to tolerate new beliefs and reshape our old ones, our mind is at risk of becoming outdated. The fixed mind becomes a relic.”

**Wisława Szymborska**, poet and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature:

“Any knowledge that doesn't lead to new questions quickly dies out: it fails to maintain the temperature required for sustaining life.”
