# 3-2-1: How to save a relationship, the key to being open-minded, and a simple guide to self-care

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Good habits stockpile ease. Bad habits postpone pain.”

---

​II.

“Distance and time are the two wedges that separate relationships.

When it really matters, get in the car (or on the plane) and meet them face-to-face.

When you want it to last, don't wait to talk about it. Solve it now before the gap becomes too wide.”

III.

Something I heard recently about being open-minded:

“The only bad view is the one you're stuck in.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Former GE executive **Ian Wilson** reminds us that life is uncertain, but you have to act anyway:

“No amount of sophistication is going to allay the fact that all your knowledge is about the past and all your decisions are about the future.”

​II.

Philosopher and novelist **Albert Camus** on self-care:

“Go out for a walk. It doesn't have to be a romantic walk in the park, spring at its most spectacular moment, flowers and smells and outstanding poetical imagery smoothly transferring you into another world. It doesn't have to be a walk during which you'll have multiple life epiphanies and discover meanings no other brain ever managed to encounter. Do not be afraid of spending quality time by yourself. Find meaning or don't find meaning but “steal” some time and give it freely and exclusively to your own self. Opt for privacy and solitude. That doesn't make you antisocial or cause you to reject the rest of the world. But you need to breathe. And you need to be.”

*Source: It is debated whether Camus actually wrote the above passage, which may have been altered over time. But he does have a number of passages about pausing the day to be alone, to walk, and to be simply present, including Carnets I and Return to Tipasa.*
