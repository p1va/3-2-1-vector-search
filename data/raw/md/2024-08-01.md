# 3-2-1: On being yourself, how to say no, and using boredom as a filter

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you'd like to get better at saying no, try this:

Keep a list of things you say no to. Whenever you ignore a distraction or turn down an opportunity, add it to the list. As the list grows, you begin to feel a sense of accomplishment for your ability to say no and remain focused on what matters.

Turn each no into an achievement.”

“Boredom is a filter. Common ideas come before it. Uncommon ideas come after it. Sit with a project long enough to get bored with it, then sit a little more. The most useful insights bubble up after you get bored.”

III.

“When you're younger, it's easy to underestimate how fleeting the days can be. Each choice matters. Each day matters.

When you're older, it's easy to underestimate how much opportunity you still have. Don't talk yourself out of it. It's never too late to start.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and cartoonist **Shel Silverstein** on being yourself:

“She had blue skin,   
And so did he.   
He kept it hid   
And so did she.   
They searched for blue   
Their whole life through,   
Then passed right by—   
And never knew.”

​II.

Poet and novelist **Sylvia Plath** reminds us that choosing a path means ignoring the rest, but not choosing means squandering them all:

“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”
