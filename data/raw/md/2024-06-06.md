# 3-2-1: How to stick to a new habit, how to handle criticism, and 4 types of wealth

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you're having trouble sticking to a new habit, try a smaller version until it becomes automatic. Do less than you're capable of, but do it more consistently than you have before.”

​II.

“It's remarkable how often the real problem is not what happened, but how it was communicated.”

III.

“There are at least 4 types of wealth:

1. Financial wealth (money)
2. Social wealth (status)
3. Time wealth (freedom)
4. Physical wealth (health)

Be wary of jobs that lure you in with 1 and 2, but rob you of 3 and 4.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

How should you measure your days? It's easy to measure your days in dollars earned or tasks completed, but there are other units of measurement to consider:

* What would you do today if you wanted to maximize laughter?
* What would you do today if you wanted to maximize time outside?
* What would you do today if you wanted to maximize peace of mind?

What unit of measurement serves you best right now?
