# 3-2-1: On knowing what you want, feedback, and facing challenges

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“A difficult lesson to learn: Your most persistent distractions will seem justified to you.”

II.

“When feedback is immediate, clear, and concrete, people learn quickly.

When feedback is delayed, abstract, and opaque, people rarely learn.”

III.

“Step 1: Know exactly what you want. Have a big vision that is crystal clear.

Step 2: Know exactly what is true. See reality for what it is and accept the honest facts of the situation.

Step 3: Be flexible in the way you close the gap between 1 and 2.

Bold. Rational. Adaptable.”
