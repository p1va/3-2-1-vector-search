# 3-2-1: On attracting luck, taking risks, and the ineffectiveness of anger

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“I rarely have good ideas.

To overcome this limitation, I think about one topic (like habits) for an unreasonable amount of time. Then, I revise, revise, revise until only the best stuff remains. It’s slow, but it works.

You can either be a genius or you can be patient.”

“You can attract luck simply by sharing your work publicly.”

III.

“For a few weeks, I started each morning by writing “What do I actually want?” at the top of a blank page.

It’s surprising how useful it is to keep asking the same question. Each time, my answer became more precise.

Once I knew what I wanted, I turned it into action steps.”

“Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else — you are the one who gets burned.”
