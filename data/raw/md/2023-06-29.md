# 3-2-1: Why small things matter, reframing failure, and how to cherish life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Small things matter when they accumulate. This is one of the main lessons of my work—and one of the principles I try to follow in my life. The details, when finely polished and carefully combined, add up to something remarkable.”

​II.

“Life rewards action, not intelligence.

Many brilliant people talk themselves out of getting started, and being smart doesn't help very much without the courage to act.

You can't win if you're not in the game.”

III.

“Start with the thing you are most motivated to do.

Start with a small habit you think is fun and do it consistently. This will not only feel satisfying, but also open your eyes to the type of person you can become.

After the first domino falls, you can use the momentum to do a little more.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and Aikido teacher**George Leonard** on how to get started:

“You can't do everything, but you can do one thing, and then another and another. In terms of energy, it's better to make a wrong choice than none at all. You might begin by listing your priorities—for the day, for the week, for the month, for a lifetime. Start modestly. List everything you want to do today or tomorrow. Set priorities by dividing the items into A, B, and C categories. At the least, accomplish the A items. Try the same thing with long-term goals. Priorities do shift, and you can change them at any time, but simply getting them down in black and white adds clarity to your life, and clarity creates energy.”

​II.

Entrepreneur and creative director **Andrew Anabi** on how to cherish life:

“When life changes, you will probably miss the way it was. You may miss those long morning drives or walks to the office, or those hectic family gatherings. You may miss them because those moments are finite — you will only travel those streets and see those people a certain amount of times.

Every time you do something that is one less time you do it. One day you will do something the final time and you will rarely know when that day comes.

For all you know, today might be the last time you walk in a particular neighborhood. Or it might be the last time you smile at a particular someone. To think otherwise, would be foolish. Nothing is guaranteed, except this moment. Your only real choice is to cherish every exchange like it is your last — because it very well might be.

Therefore, the best way to cherish life is to remind yourself of life's impermanence. It is to remember that every time you see someone that is one less time you see them. It is to remember that every time you go somewhere that is one less time you visit. By doing this, you naturally slow down. Almost like a reflex, you start to truly live.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Think of a time you failed or struggled greatly.

If you were to view that experience in a more useful way, what story would you tell yourself? What did it teach you? How did it prepare you for what came next?

Turn your failures into lessons.
