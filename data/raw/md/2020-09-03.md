# 3-2-1: On patience, vision, and emphasizing joy

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The most overlooked and underappreciated growth strategy is patience.

(More specifically, consistently producing great work over a long time horizon.)”

II.

“Build before you have to.

– Build knowledge before you have to.  
– Build strength before you have to.  
– Build an emergency fund before you have to.

Let internal pressure drive you today, so you can handle external pressure tomorrow.”

III.

“Vision is the bottleneck of talent.

Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. It’s not a lack of effort, but a lack of direction.

There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet **Lucille Clifto****n** on emphasizing joy over status:

“One should wish to celebrate more than one wishes to be celebrated.”

*Source: 1992 interview for Poets & Writers Magazine*

---

II.

The philosophers **Willard Van Orman Quine** and **J.S. Ullian** on the difference between being right and having been right: 

“The desire to *be right* and the desire to *have been right* are two desires, and the sooner we separate them the better off we are. The desire to be right is the thirst for truth. On all counts, both practical and theoretical, there is nothing but good to be said for it. The desire to have been right, on the other hand, is the pride that goeth before a fall. It stands in the way of our seeing we were wrong, and thus blocks the progress of our knowledge.”
