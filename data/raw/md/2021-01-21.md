“Things that keep talented people from fulfilling their potential:

– Trying to please everyone  
– Imitating the desires of others  
– Chasing status without questioning why  
– Playing superhero and trying to do it all alone  
– Dividing your attention between too many projects”

“When I notice myself worrying about “what other people will think” I find I’m usually not worried about any single person’s opinion.

If I pick a specific person, I‘m rarely concerned about what they will think.

What I fear is the collective opinion in my head. It’s imaginary.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

II.

Historian **Barbara Tuchman** on the power of books:

“Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print.”
