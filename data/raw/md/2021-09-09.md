# 3-2-1: How friendship happens, letting go, and revision

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Big things start small, but not every small thing can become big.

You need to be on the right trajectory. Choose the right playing field and success comes more easily.”

​II.

“When failure is reversible, act quickly.

When failure is irreversible, think carefully.”

III.

“Friendship happens on the way to something else.

If you “try to meet new people” it feels weird and forced. The more you aim for friendship, the more it eludes you.

But if you aim to learn or achieve something with others, friendship happens naturally during the shared pursuit.”

The theologian **Dorothee Sölle** on letting go:

“If my hands are fully occupied in holding on to something, I can neither give nor receive.”

​II.

Entrepreneur and computer scientist **Arthur van Hoff** on revision:

“Over the years, I've learned that the first idea you have is irrelevant. It's just a catalyst for you to get started. Then you figure out what's wrong with it and you go through phases of denial, panic, regret. And then you finally have a better idea and the second idea is always the important one.”
