## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Wisdom is the echo of experience.”

​II.

“Early feedback is usually better than late criticism. Delaying the conversation or stringing someone along with indirect feedback won't make them feel better once the real issue is finally addressed. Nobody likes getting bad news, but everyone appreciates clarity.”

---

III.

“A simple recipe for finding opportunities:

1. Be pleasant
2. Ask questions
3. Engage daily

It's hard for a warm and pleasant person who is asking a lot of questions and engaging in their industry daily to not come across interesting opportunities.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Entrepreneur and investor **Paul Graham** on fooling yourself:

“If you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.”

​II.

Writer and scholar **C.S. Lewis** on what why small choices matter:

“Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of. An apparently trivial indulgence in lust or anger today is the loss of a ridge or railway line or bridgehead from which the enemy may launch an attack otherwise impossible.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

There are two ways to grow: by adding or by shedding.

Do you need to add something or do you need to shed something?
