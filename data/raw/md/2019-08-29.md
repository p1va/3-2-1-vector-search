# 3-2-1: On feeling misunderstood, thinking clearly, and making the most of your one life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“You know yourself mostly by your thoughts.

Remember this when you feel misunderstood. You have to do or say something for others to know how you feel.”

II.

“A strategy for thinking clearly: Rather than trying to be right, assume you are wrong and try to be less wrong.

Trying to be right has a tendency to devolve into protecting your beliefs.

Trying to be less wrong has a tendency to prompt more questions and intellectual humility.”

III.

“Habits will form whether you want them or not.

Whatever you repeat, you reinforce.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Sam Altman**, an entrepreneur and chairman of Y Combinator, on making the most of your one life:

“Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it. Make it count.

“Time is extremely limited and goes by fast. Do what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway. Don’t do stuff that doesn’t make you happy (this happens most often when other people want you to do something). Don’t spend time trying to maintain relationships with people you don’t like, and cut negative people out of your life…

“The days are long but the decades are short.”

Altman's quote contrasts nicely with a saying I heard from a friend's grandmother:

“Life is short, but life is also long. You have to live with your choices.”
