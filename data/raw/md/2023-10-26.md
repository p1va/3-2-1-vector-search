# 3-2-1: How to handle errors, eliminating points of failure, and the willingness to look foolish

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Don't overlook the basics. Don't ignore the foundation. How long can a tree remain standing without roots?”

​II.

“Simplify. What can be done in three steps should never be done in four. Each link in the chain is a potential breaking point. Fewer links means fewer chances of failure.”

III.

“When you tolerate an error, you rob yourself of learning.

When you ruminate on an error, you rob yourself of happiness.

Notice it, improve it, and move on from it.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Haruki Murakami** on the value of reading widely:

“If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.”

​II.

Aikido instructor **George Leonard** on the willingness to look foolish:

“It's possible that one of the reasons you got on the path of mastery was to look good. But to learn something new of any significance, you have to be willing to look foolish…

When a Most Valuable Player candidate misjudges a ball and falls on his duff, he does it in the sight of millions. You should be willing to do it before your teacher and a few friends or fellow students. If you're always thinking about appearances, you can never attain the state of concentration that's necessary for effective learning and top performance.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Think of your childhood. What is one area where your parents did a good job? What is one area where they could have done better?
