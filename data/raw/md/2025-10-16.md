# 3-2-1: A simple practice for peace, how to become disciplined, and being bold

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Intelligence isn't just about what you know. It is also the ability to avoid being your own bottleneck.

* If you lack the skills, be willing to look foolish while you learn them.
* If you lack the connections, be courageous enough to reach out and build them.
* If you feel uncertain, be bold enough to figure it out along the way.

Many people have the ability, but they talk themselves out of trying.”

​II.

“Your thoughts and actions belong to you just like your possessions. Every so often, it helps to declutter—donate old clothes or clear out a crowded shelf. Maybe it's time to let go of some unhelpful thoughts or outdated actions too?”

III.

Pause and try this simple practice from Thich Nhat Hanh:

“Breathe in, and close your eyes.

Breathe out, and smile.”

​II.

Author **Kurt Vonnegut** teaches us that growth and originality come at the edge:

“I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center. Big, undreamed‑of things—the people on the edge see them first.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Consistency cannot be guaranteed, but you can create the conditions to make it more likely. Before you try to become a more disciplined person, how are you creating a more disciplined environment?
