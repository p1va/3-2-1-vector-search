# 3-2-1: On character, the process of improvement, and mastering one thing

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The way someone else perceives what you do is a result of their own experiences (which you can’t control), their own preferences (which you can’t predict), and their own expectations (which you don’t set).

If your choices don’t match their expectations that is their concern, not yours.”

​II.

“A recipe for getting more out of what you read:

Start more books. Quit most of them. Read the great ones twice.”

III.

“The most reliable way to change your life is by not changing your entire life.

If you try to change everything all at once, you will quickly find yourself pulled back into the same patterns as before. But if you merely focus on changing one specific habit and work on it until it becomes part of your normal day, you will find your life changes naturally as a side effect.

Improve the whole by mastering one thing.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Science writer and producer **Ann Druyan** on the process of improvement:

“Test ideas by experiment and observation. Build on those ideas that pass the test. Reject the ones that fail. Follow the evidence wherever it leads. And question everything, including authority. Do these things and the cosmos is yours.”

Advice columnist **Abigail Van Buren** on character:

“The best index to a person's character is (a) how he treats people who can't do him any good, and (b) how he treats people who can't fight back.”
