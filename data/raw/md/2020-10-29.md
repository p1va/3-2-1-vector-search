# 3-2-1: On selective ignorance, courage, and living a life that burns bright

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Be “selectively ignorant.”

Ignore topics that drain your attention.

Unfollow people that drain your energy.

Abandon projects that drain your time.

Do not keep up with it all. The more selectively ignorant you become, the more broadly knowledgeable you can be.”

---

II.

“Reading can teach you the best of what others already know.

Reflection can teach you the best of what only you can know.”

---

III.

“The math of success…

Results = (Hard Work\*Time)^Strategy

Working hard is important, but working on the right thing is more important. A great strategy can deliver exponential results.

Of course, the best strategy is worth nothing if you never get to work. Zero to the millionth power is still zero.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

The writer **Anais Nin** on how to unlock a bigger, fuller life:

“Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.”​

II.

Writer **George Bernard Shaw** on living a life that burns bright:

“This is the true joy in life:

being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one;

being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.

I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live.

I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no “brief candle” for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.”
