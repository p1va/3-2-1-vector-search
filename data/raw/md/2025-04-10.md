# 3-2-1: Two steps for better results, the qualities of a great career, and how to handle good luck

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The 2-step process for exceptional results:

1. Spend a little time each day thinking about the highest leverage activity available to you.
2. Spend a little time each day working on it.”

---

​II.

“The feeling of progress is one of the best feelings of all. This is true even when progress is small.”

---

III.

“The 4 qualities of a great career:

1. I enjoy it
2. I'm good at it
3. I make good money
4. I’m around fascinating people

Answer in reverse order:

1. Where are fascinating people?
2. In what ways can I make money with them?
3. Which ones am I good at?
4. Which ones do I enjoy?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Novelist **Marilynne Robinson** on how to handle good luck:

“I can only make sense of my unaccountable good fortune by assuming that it means I am under special obligation to make good use of it.”

​II.

Author **Ben Short** reminds us why the hard work is worth it:

“… looking at the work done and the work still to do, most people would have written the whole thing off as too much sweat for too little gain. But I didn't want an easy life. I wanted a beautiful one.”
