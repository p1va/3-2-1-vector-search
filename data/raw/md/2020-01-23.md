II.

“On minimalism:

The goal is not to have the least amount of things, but the optimal amount of things.

Two important footnotes:

(1) The optimal amount depends on your goals.  
(2) The optimal amount is almost always less than you think.”

III.

“Reading is like a software update for your brain.

Whenever you learn a new concept or idea, the ‘software' improves. You download new features and fix old bugs.

In this way, reading a good book can give you a new way to view your life experiences. Your past is fixed, but your interpretation of it can change depending on the software you use to analyze it.”

II.

**Seneca**, one of the great Roman Stoic philosophers, on friendship:

“…nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up!”
