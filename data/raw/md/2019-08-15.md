# 3-2-1: On mastery, learning to let go of trivial arguments, and bias

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Mastery requires both impatience and patience.

The impatience to have a bias toward action, to not waste time, and to work with a sense of urgency each day.

The patience to delay gratification, to wait for your actions to accumulate, and to trust the process.”

II.

“When making plans, think big.

When making progress, think small.”

III.

“A simple strategy that will save you so many headaches: don't care about winning trivial arguments.

Did someone say something you don't agree with? Smile, nod, and move on to more important things.

Life is short. Learning to not care about having the last word will save you so much time.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Morgan Housel** on bias:

“Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works… We’re all biased to our own personal history.”

II.

Housel's quote contrasts nicely with this advice from British writer **Norman Douglas**:

“There are some things you can't learn from others. You have to pass through the fire.”
