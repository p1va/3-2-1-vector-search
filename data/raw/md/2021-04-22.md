​II.

“The best properties are rarely for sale.

The best employees are rarely job hunting.

The best clients are rarely shopping.

The best option is usually off the market. Most people think this means you can’t have it. What it really means is you have to go find it and sell yourself.”

III.

“The Paradox of Focus:

Make the most of one opportunity and more opportunities will come your way.

Moving boldly in one direction causes more paths to unfold before you.

To get more, focus on less.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

A **Chilean saying** on criticism:

“Criticizing a musician is easy, but it is more difficult when you have a guitar in your hand.”

*Source: I'm told the original saying is, “Otra cosa es con guitarra.”*

​II.

A letter from author **Anne Lamott** on the value of reading:

“If you love to read, or learn to love reading, you will have an amazing life. Period. Life will always have hardships, pressure, and incredibly annoying people, but books will make it all worthwhile. In books, you will find your North Star, and you will find you, which is why you are here.  
​  
Books are paper ships, to all the worlds, to ancient Egypt, outer space, eternity, into the childhood of your favorite musician, and — the most precious stunning journey of all — into your own heart, your own family, your own history and future and body.  
​  
Out of these flat almost two-dimensional boxes of paper will spring mountains, lions, concerts, galaxies, heroes. You will meet people who have been all but destroyed, who have risen up and will bring you with them. Books and stories are medicine, plaster casts for broken lives and hearts, slings for weakened spirits. And in reading, you will laugh harder than you ever imagined laughing, and this will be magic, heaven, and salvation. I promise.”

If I keep doing what I am about to do today for the next five years, will I end up with more of what I want or less of what I want?
