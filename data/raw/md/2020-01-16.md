# 3-2-1: On getting started as a writer, the benefits of teaching, and growing old

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“It’s never been a better time for self-motivated people.

Anyone connected to the internet has the education power of a university and the distribution power of a media company at their fingertips.

Curiosity, courage, and persistence are the new gatekeepers.”

III.

“3 tips for getting started as a writer:

1. Publish on a schedule. Consistency develops ability.

2. Share your writing publicly. Writing is a magnet. It attracts like-minded people.

3. Write about what fascinates you. You don't need to be an expert. Curiosity leads to expertise.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Robert Heinlein** on the benefits of teaching:

“When one teaches, two learn.”

---

II.

British philosopher **Bertrand Russell** on how to grow old. (Russell wrote this at age 81 and went on to live another 16 years.)

“The best way to overcome [the fear of death]—so at least it seems to me—is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life.

“An individual human existence should be like a river: small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.

“The person who, in old age, can see life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he or she cares for will continue. And if, with the decay of vitality, weariness increases, the thought of rest will not be unwelcome.

“I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.”
