# 3-2-1: How to start a new habit, the costs of success, and a simple gift you can give yourself

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“It's hard to build momentum if you keep dividing your attention.”

---

​II.

“When determining the size or complexity of a new habit ask yourself: What can I stick to — even on my worst day?

Start there. Master the art of showing up. Then advance.”

---

III.

“A gift you can give yourself right now:

Stop what you're doing. Close your eyes.

For the next 60 seconds, just breathe.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist **Paulo Coelho** reminds us to fix our mistakes quickly:

“You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.”

​II.

**Estée Lauder,** entrepreneur and founder of the famous cosmetics brand, on the power of focus:

“I've always believed that if you stick to a thought and carefully avoid distraction along the way, you can fulfill a dream. My whole life has been about fulfilling dreams. I kept my eye on the target, whatever that target was. Whether your target is big or small, grand or simple, ambitious or personal, I've always believed that success comes from not letting your eyes stray from that target. Anyone who wants to achieve a dream must stay strong, focused and steady.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

I recently asked a friend if he wanted to hit a certain business milestone and he said, “That depends. What does it cost me?”

Writing down your goals is easy. Everybody wants the glamorous result. What really matters is whether you want the costs associated with it: the money, the time, the tradeoffs.

Don't merely ask yourself what do I want to achieve, but also what am I willing to pay?
