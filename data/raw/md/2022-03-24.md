“Good marketing can sell once, but only a good product can sell twice.

In the long run, your performance reverts to the value you provide.”

III.

“Motivation comes and goes. If you want to do something consistently, then don't pick a level of difficulty that requires great motivation.

Make it easy enough and simple enough that you'll do it even when you don't feel very motivated.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Psychologist and author **Adam Grant** on criticism:

“Criticizing is easy and fast. Creating is difficult and slow. The two hours you spent on a book or movie usually took two years to produce.

Anyone can tear down someone else’s work. The true test of insight is whether you can help them improve it or build something of your own.”

​II.

Physician **Chris Ballas**, more commonly known under his pen name The Last Psychiatrist, on the goal of adulthood:

“The goal of adulthood is to let go of the other possible existences and to make the best of the one. A successful adult is one who understands that it doesn't matter which life you ultimately pick, only that you live it well.”
