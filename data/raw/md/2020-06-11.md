# 3-2-1:  On the role of habits in times of uncertainty, hard work, and change

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“In times of uncertainty, your habits can ground you.

When you feel overwhelmed, practice 1 minute of mindfulness.

When you feel restless, do a 1-minute workout.

When the world seems uncontrollable, focus on what you can control.”

II.

“The two skills of modern business: Storytelling and spreadsheets.

Know the numbers. Craft the narrative.”

III.

“People keep reading self-help and revisiting the same ideas because that’s precisely what we need: to be reminded.

The problem is not that information is unhelpful, but that attention is fleeting.

Nobody focuses on one idea every minute of the day. Good books refocus the mind.”
