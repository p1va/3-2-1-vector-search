# 3-2-1: On cheat codes, love as a creative force, and how to make something great

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“There are all kinds of cheat codes lying around, but they usually look boring. People will routinely ignore things that already work for the hope of a slightly easier path. The cheat code is the work you're avoiding.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Graphic designer and painter **Paula Scher** on how to make something great:

“Less is more and more is more. It's the middle that's not a good place.”

​II.

Playwright and poet **Sarah Ruhl** on love as a creative force:

“There was once a very great American surgeon named Halsted. He was married to a nurse. He loved her—immeasurably.

One day Halsted noticed that his wife's hands were chapped and red when she came back from surgery. And so he invented rubber gloves. For her. It is one of the great love stories in medicine. The difference between inspired medicine and uninspired medicine is love…

[He] loved her to the point of invention.”
