# 3-2-1: Moving fast, solving problems, and the various ways to succeed

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The most important battles must be fought anew each day.

Exercising today does not render tomorrow's workout unnecessary.

Supporting your spouse today does not mean you can mail it in tomorrow.

Learn to love the endless nature of things and life gets easier.”

​II.

“As far as life philosophies go, “The right time is right now” isn't a bad one. Most of us would benefit from a greater bias toward action.

If you move fast, you can try more things. And if you try more things, you're likely to find something that works for you.”

III.

“Remove the branches of a thorn bush today and you'll avoid a scrape this year. But next year, you'll face the same problem again.

Remove the root of the bush today, and the entire plant will die.

Are you solving problems at the branch level or the root level?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist **Doris Lessing** on the various ways to succeed:

“We all of us have limited amounts of energy, and I am sure the people who are successful have learned, either by instinct or consciously, to use their energies well instead of spilling them about. And this has to be different for every person, writers or otherwise. I know writers who go to parties every night and then, recharged instead of depleted, happily write all day. But if I stay up half the night talking, I don’t do so well the next day. Some writers like to start work as soon as they can in the morning, while others like the night or—for me almost impossible—the afternoons. Trial and error, and then when you’ve found your needs, what feeds you, what is your instinctive rhythm and routine, then cherish it.”

​II.

Husband and wife combo, **Benjamin Zander,** a longtime conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and **Rosamund Zander,** a family therapist, on the power of point of view:

“Every problem, every dilemma, every dead end we find ourselves facing in life, only appears unsolvable inside a particular frame or point of view. Enlarge the box, or create another frame around the data, and problems vanish, while new opportunities appear.”
