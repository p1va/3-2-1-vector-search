“Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world and little of yourself.

Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.

High standards, low expectations.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer **F. Scott Fitzgerald** on what makes a brilliant mind:

“The test of a first-rate intellect is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in your head at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.”

​II.

Psychologist **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi** on the value of daily surprises:

“Try to be surprised by something every day. It could be something you see, hear, or read about. Stop to look at the unusual car parked at the curb, taste the new item on the cafeteria menu, actually listen to your colleague at the office. How is this different from other similar cars, dishes or conversations? What is its essence? Don't assume that you already know what these things are all about, or that even if you knew them, they wouldn't matter anyway. Experience this one thing for what it is, not what you think it is. Be open to what the world is telling you. Life is nothing more than a stream of experiences — the more widely and deeply you swim in it, the richer your life will be.”
