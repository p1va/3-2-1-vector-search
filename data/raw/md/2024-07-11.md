# 3-2-1: On feeling foolish, the importance of dreams, and dealing with critics

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The first minute of action is worth more than a year of perfect planning.”

​II.

“One of the great mistakes in life is suffering for years because you didn't want to feel foolish for five minutes.

* You don't want to apologize, so you let a relationship deteriorate.
* You're scared of the sting of rejection, so you don't ask for what you want.
* You fear people will say your idea is dumb, so you never start the business.

Nobody likes feeling foolish, but the feeling fades quickly. The willingness to endure five minutes of discomfort turns out to be a meaningful dividing line in life.”

III.

“In my early 20s, I wrote a list of ambitious things I wanted to do in life. Go bungee jumping. Create a movie. Start a business. That sort of thing. I did a few of them, but not most.

Looking back, however, that list was incredibly valuable because it taught me the usefulness of chasing bold ideas—even if they never materialize. The dreams that didn't happen changed shape and led me down other interesting paths.

The important thing isn't to achieve all your dreams, but to keep dreaming. Your desires change as you learn and grow. Old dreams will spawn new dreams. And eventually, one of these newer, more refined visions will find their moment and become reality.”
