# 3-2-1: On creating meaning, the remarkable odds of your existence, and life instructions

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Aim to be great in 10 years.

Build health habits today that lead to a great body in 10 years.

Build social habits today that lead to great relationships in 10 years.

Build learning habits today that lead to great knowledge in 10 years.

Long-term thinking is a secret weapon.”

II.

“If you…

1) develop a bias for moving fast

2) consistently ask, “What’s the real goal here and is there a better way to accomplish it?”

… you can accomplish a lot in one life.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The author and generally hilarious human, **Bill Bryson,** on the remarkable odds of your existence:

“Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result — eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly — in you.

*Bonus quote:*

Bryson's description reminds me of a comment by the astrophysicist **Carl Sagan** on the rarity of life in the universe:

“Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.”

The poet and Pulitzer Prize winner **Mary Oliver** with some suggestions for your one precious life:

“Instructions for living a life: Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it.”
