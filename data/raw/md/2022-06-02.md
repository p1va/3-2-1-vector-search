## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“It's only work if you would rather be doing something else.

Find a way to carve a career out of what you already want to do.”

​II.

“Build small habits. Make big plans.

1) Keep your daily actions small. Strive to get 1% better every day.

2) Keep your daily mindset big. Think about how you can play a bigger game.

Start small, but never dream small.”

III.

“Great work resists compression.

Great explanations are short, but potent.

Great software delivers the same outcome in fewer clicks.

Great manufacturing processes create products in less time and with less waste.

The shape of genius is simplicity.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Computer scientist **Alan Kay** on the value of looking at old things in a new way:

​II.

Painter **Mariam Paré,** who specializes in making paintings by mouth after suffering a spinal cord injury, offers some advice to her younger self:

“If I could talk to myself twenty years ago, I would tell myself to focus on my strengths, and not on my weaknesses; on the things I could do and not the things I couldn’t do; to strive to excel and hone those skills to the point of excellence. That this was the best strategy to secure my future. I would say to myself that the only real obstacles you have are those you create for yourself.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Sometimes we are too hard on ourselves and criticize our mistakes to an unhelpful degree. Sometimes we are too easy on ourselves and let excuses run our lives.

Which way are you leaning right now? How can you pull yourself back to center?
