# 3-2-1: Planning for failure and preparing for luck

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Never expect to fail, but always plan for it.

The fastest way to get back on track is to have a plan for when you're off it.”

“In many cases, improvement is not about doing more things right, but about doing less things wrong.

Don't look for things to add. Look for things to eliminate.”

III.

“We cannot control our luck—good or bad—but we can control our effort and preparation.

Luck smiles on us all from time to time. And when it does, the way to honor your good luck is to work hard and make the most of it.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Executive coach **Cherie Carter-Scott** on life-long learning:

“Lessons are repeated until they are learned. A lesson will be presented to you in various forms until you have learned it. When you have learned it, you can go on to the next lesson.

Learning lessons does not end. There's no part of life that doesn't contain its lessons. If you're alive, that means there are still lessons to be learned.”

​II.

Author and journalist **Mitch Albom** on time:

“Try to imagine a life without timekeeping. You probably can’t. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.”
