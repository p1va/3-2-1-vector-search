# 3-2-1: On the surprising path to success, the value of downtime, and how parenting changes you

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Take all the energy you spend on…

* worrying about the past
* worrying about the future
* worrying about what others think
* worrying about if you might fail

… and channel that energy into one useful action within your control.”

---

​II.

“Stories of failure resonate more than stories of success. Few people reach the top, but everyone has failed—including those who eventually succeed. If you're teaching people how to succeed in a given field (or talking about your own success), start with how you failed.”

---

III.

“Success is largely the failures you avoid.

* Health is the injuries you don't sustain.
* Wealth is the purchases you don't make.
* Happiness is the objects you don't desire.
* Peace of mind is the arguments you don't engage.

Avoid the bad to protect the good.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Banker and archaeologist **John Lubbock** on the value of downtime:

“Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.”
