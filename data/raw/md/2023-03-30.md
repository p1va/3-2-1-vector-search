# 3-2-1: The most important habit, the difference between ambition and entitlement, and friendship

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The most important habit is choosing the right habit to work on.”

​II.

“Ambition is when you expect yourself to close the gap between what you have and what you want.

Entitlement is when you expect others to close the gap between what you have and what you want.”

III.

“It's generally better to over-communicate.

If you wait to reply because you don't have an answer yet (or because you don't want to share bad news), the other party often ends up making assumptions about what the delayed reply might mean.

Silence frustrates and confuses people. Better to communicate early and often.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Ronald Sharp** on how friendship transforms us (or any great relationship, really):

“It’s not about what someone can do for you, it's who and what the two of you become in each other's presence.”

​II.

**Tara Ploughman** with an obvious, but often ignored, insight:

“Never offer what you'd hate someone for accepting.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Does this habit still serve me or am I blindly following an old routine?
