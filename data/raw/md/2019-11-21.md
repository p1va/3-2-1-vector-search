## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.”

II.

“How long does it take to build a habit?

21 days? 30 days? 66 days?

The honest answer is: forever. Because once you stop doing it, it is no longer a habit.

A habit is a lifestyle to be lived, not a finish line to be crossed. Make small, sustainable changes you can stick with.”

III.

“The highest level of mastery is simplicity.

Most information is irrelevant and most effort is wasted, but only the expert knows what to ignore.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist and playwright **Edith Wharton** on being a positive force:

“There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.”

II.

**John Gardner**, a politician and a recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom, on how to live a meaningful life:

“Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.”
