# 3-2-1: One of the most valuable skills in life, and starting before you feel ready

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Just because improvements aren't visible doesn't mean they aren't happening.

You're not going to see the number change each time you step on the scale. You're not going to finish a chapter each time you sit down to write.

Early wins come easy. Lasting wins require a lifestyle.”

“One of the most valuable skills in life is being able to see another person's perspective.

If you're going to someone's house, think about how it might feel to be the host. If you're creating a product, spend as much time as possible thinking like the customer. If you're calling customer service, think about how it might feel to be on the other end of the conversation.

The more clearly you understand the viewpoint of your spouse or customer or coworker, the better positioned you are to find a solution.”

III.

“Live the Pareto Principle lifestyle:

Relationships. Who are the few people that have the most positive impact on my life? Spend more time with them.

Priorities. What are the few actions that have the most positive impact on my day? Prioritize them.

Learning. What are the few information sources I learn the most from? Focus on them.

Stress. What are the few sources that cause most of the stress and friction in my life? Eliminate them.”

Author **Annie Dillard** offers a change of pace from modern life:

“The most appealing daily schedule I know is that of a turn-of-the-century Danish aristocrat. He got up at four and set out on foot to hunt black grouse, wood grouse, woodcock, and snipe. At eleven he met his friends, who had also been out hunting alone all morning. They converged “at one of these babbling brooks,” he wrote.

He outlined the rest of his schedule. “Take a quick dip, relax with a schnapps and a sandwich, stretch out, have a smoke, take a nap or just rest, and then sit around and chat until three. Then I hunt some more until sundown, bathe again, put on a white tie and tails to keep up appearances, eat a huge dinner, smoke a cigar and sleep like a log until the sun comes up again to redden the eastern sky. This is living … Could it be more perfect?”
