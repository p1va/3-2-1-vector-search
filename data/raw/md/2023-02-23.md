# 3-2-1: Creativity, taking action, and the two-step process for exceptional results

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The 2-step process for exceptional results:

(1) Spend a little time each day thinking about the highest leverage activity available to you.

(2) Spend a little time each day working on it.”

​II.

“With the creative process, the key is to create a lot and edit a lot.

Make more than you need, then remove everything that isn't exceptional.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Is it better to delay getting started by weeks or months so I can be fully prepared? Or is it better to start right now with little to no preparation?
