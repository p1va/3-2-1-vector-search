# 3-2-1: The New Year, second chances, and a simple way to start striving toward your dreams

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“10-year dreams. 5-minute actions.

Where do I want to be in 10 years?

What can I do in the next 5 minutes to contribute to that outcome?”

​II.

“Anyone can listen. All you have to do is stop talking.

But to be a *good* listener, you have to stop talking and *be interested*.

Genuine curiosity is the precursor to understanding, and a good listener helps the other person feel understood.”

III.

“You can graduate with the finest degrees. You can read the most useful books. You can enjoy the loving support of family and friends.

But your degrees can't take action for you. Your books can't make the decision for you. Your family can't live your life for you.

There is no substitute for courage. At some point, you have to make the choice.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Patricia Digh** on the New Year:

“At the end of each year, I ask myself two questions:

1) What do I want to create in this New Year?

And, perhaps even more importantly,

2) What do I want to let go of?”

​II.

Writer **Jeanette Winterson** on second chances:

“I know now, after fifty years, that the finding/losing, forgetting/remembering, leaving/returning, never stops. The whole of life is about another chance, and while we are alive, till the very end, there is always another chance.”
