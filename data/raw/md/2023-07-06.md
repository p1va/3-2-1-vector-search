## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Curiosity is the beginning of knowledge. Action is the beginning of change.”

​II.

“Passion is a feeling that follows action. It tends to be created or discovered, not predicted or planned. You don't find your passion. It finds you as you get in the mix and try things.”

III.

“Highly focused people do not leave their options open. They select their priorities and are comfortable ignoring the rest. If you commit to nothing, you’ll be distracted by everything.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**The Dhammapada,** a collection of Buddhist scriptures, on the power of your mind:

“What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow. Our life is the creation of our mind.”

​II.

Singer and songwriter **David Bowie** on how to produce your best work:

“If you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth, and when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It's easy to find ways to improve when you are genuinely curious about something. Rather than asking yourself, “How can I be better at this?” start by asking, “How can I be more curious about this?”
