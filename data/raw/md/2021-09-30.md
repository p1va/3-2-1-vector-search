​II.

“If you want to find a better path, you have to be willing to explore a different path.

That sounds simple, but how often do you try something different?”

III.

“How to build a career in 7 steps:

1. Do great work.

2. Share it publicly.

3. Cold email people 2 steps ahead of you.

4. Talk about your work and trade ideas.

5. Host events and meet in-person.

6. Become friends.

7. Rise together.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Abolitionist, author, and runaway slave **Frederick Douglass** on taking action:

​II.

The painter **Bridget Riley** on paying attention to boredom:

“Boredom is a tremendous indicator. Your energy goes; it caves in on you; you can’t do anything. That’s very frightening but you must listen because you are being told that whatever it is you are doing is not quite right. It may only need a small adjustment or it may need more drastic treatment.”
