# 3-2-1: On freedom and responsibility, “bad” workouts, and obligations

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The most satisfying form of freedom is not a life without responsibilities, but a life where you are free to choose your responsibilities.”

II.

“The ‘bad' workouts are often the most important ones.

It's easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope.

Going to gym for 5 minutes might not transform your body, but it does reaffirm your identity.”

III.

“My wife shared a bit of wisdom with me recently, and I’d like to pass it along to you today…

You can be happy with who you are and still want to be better. You can love your body and still want to improve it. You can appreciate your financial state and still want to improve it.

Progress does not require self-loathing. You can feel successful along the way.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

We are celebrating Thanksgiving this week in the U.S., and so I'd like to share two quotes about being grateful for what you have:

I.

**John Bogle**, founder of Vanguard, shares a life lesson:

“At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, the late Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, the author Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch 22 over its whole history.

“Heller responded, ‘Yes, but I have something he will never have … Enough.'”

II.

The author **Esther Hicks** on living well:

“If all you did was just looked for things to appreciate, you would live a joyously spectacular life.”
