# 3-2-1: The measure of success, courage, and knowing what you want

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Double down on your best relationship.

It's the investment with the highest return.”

​II.

“People who jump from project to project are always dividing their effort, and producing high quality work becomes difficult without intense effort.

Meanwhile, your average work day can be leisurely, yet also productive, if you return to the same project each day.

Do one thing well and watch it compound.”

III.

“Life is easier when you know what you want—but most people don't take the time to figure out what they want.

It's not that we are completely lost, but our efforts are often slightly misdirected. People will work for years and ultimately achieve a lifestyle that isn't quite what they were hoping for—often, simply, because they never clearly defined what they wanted.

An hour of thinking can save you a decade of work.”

I.

Novelist **Toni Morrison** on the measure of success:

“For me, success is not a public thing. It's a private thing. It's when you have fewer and fewer regrets.”

​II.

Novelist and art theorist **André Malraux** on courage:

“Often the difference between a successful person and a failure is not one's better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on one's ideas, to take a calculated risk—and to act.”
