II.

“Balance is timing, not intensity.

It is not doing multiple tasks at 80%, but developing the skill of turning it on and turning it off.

Sleep fully, then work intensely. Focus deeply, then relax completely. Give each phase your full attention.

Balance is ‘when to' not ‘how to.'”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

An excerpt from the poem **“Youth” by Samuel Ullman****,**a Jewish poet:

“Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust. Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and the joy of the game of living.”

**Xun Zi****,**a Chinese philosopher living around 312 BC, on the importance of focus:

“The person attempting to travel two roads at once will get nowhere.”
