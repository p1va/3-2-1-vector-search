# 3-2-1: On taking action, writing well, and motivating others

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If the only reason you're not pursuing a dream is because of the length of time it will take to achieve it, you should start right now. Think long-term.”

II.

“Don’t write to sound smart. Write to be useful.

If you’re useful over a long time period, you will end up looking smart anyway.”

III.

“The difference between motion and action.

Motion:

-talk to a personal trainer  
-research your book idea  
-explore different types of meditation

Action:

-do 10 squats  
-write 1 sentence  
-meditate for 1 minute

Motion feels like progress. Action is progress.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The author and aviator **Antoine de Saint-Exupéry** on motivating others:

“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast endless sea.”

II.

Entrepreneur **Patrick Collison** on the value of reading:

“You could try to pound your head against the wall and think of original ideas or you can cheat by reading them in books.”
