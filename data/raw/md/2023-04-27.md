I.

Something I heard recently and I've tried to adopt whenever possible:

“Whoever has the most fun, wins.”

“Water never complains, but always pushes back. Always.

Drop a boulder in front of a stream and the water will simply flow around it, taking whatever opening the landscape will give or—when nothing is offered—patiently building up its resources until it rises to a height where a new gap is found.

Persist like water. When an obstacle is placed in front of you, find your way around or gather your resources until a new opportunity reveals itself.”

III.

“Time assets vs. Time debts.

Time assets are choices that save you time in the future. Think: saying no to a meeting, automating a task, working on something that persists and compounds.

Time debts are choices that must be repaid and cost you time in the future. Think: saying yes to a meeting, doing sloppy work that will need to be revised, etc.

Time assets are an investment. Time debts are an expense.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Actress **Elizabeth Bibesco** on the importance of failure:

“We learn nothing by being right.”

​II.

Author and recovering alcoholic **Sarah Hepola** on slow change:

“Change is not a bolt of lightning that arrives with a zap. It is a bridge built brick by brick, every day, with sweat and humility and slips. It is hard work, and slow work, but it can be thrilling to watch it take shape.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Apply the Pareto Principle to your relationships. Who are the few people that deliver the majority of happiness in your life? Can you schedule time with one of them today?
