​II.

“Nearly everything in life is unfavorable once it grows to a certain size.

It is entirely possible to have too many clients, too much work, too much fame, too much free time, and so on.

Pay attention to when the thing you're chasing exceeds its usefulness.”

III.

“The strategies that made you successful in the past will, at some point, reach their limit.

Don't let your previous choices set your future ceiling. The willingness to try new ideas allows you to keep advancing.”

## 2 QUOTE FROM OTHERS

I.

Military strategist **Sun Tzu** on preparation:

“The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.”
