# 3-2-1: Two competing truths, acceptance, and media consumption habits

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Two competing truths:

– The more prepared person usually wins.

– You get credit for action, not preparation.”

​II.

“What appears to be a rapid shift is often preceded by a gradual process. Our results gradually explode or vanish thanks to the small habits we repeat each day.

What radical change are you slowly marching toward? An incremental explosion or an incremental vanishing?”

---

III.

“One type of person approaches a situation with the mindset of, “How can I make this work?”

Another type seems to approach each circumstance with the mindset of, “What are all the reasons this wouldn’t work?”

Both people will be forced to deal with reality, but the first person will only have to solve problems that actually occur while the second person will often avoid taking action entirely because of the potential problems they have dreamt up before starting.

There will always be reasons to not do something. Be a problem solver, not a problem adder.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet and naturalist **Diane Ackerman** on life:

“I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to live the width of it as well.”

​II.

Writer **Wes Angelozzi** on acceptance:

“Go and love someone exactly as they are. And then watch how quickly they transform into the greatest, truest version of themselves. When one feels seen and appreciated in their own essence, one is instantly empowered.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

A (slightly modified) question from writer [Nat Eliason](https://twitter.com/nateliason/status/1570099812946567175) on your consumption habits:

“What percentage of the media you consume on a daily basis was created in the last year? What percentage of the best and most useful information was created in the last year?”
