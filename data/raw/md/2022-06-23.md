III.

“Mental toughness is often portrayed as determination and persistence, but it can also be flexibility and adaptability.

– I can be happy anywhere.

– I can work with what I have.

– I can have a good day with anyone.

You are tough when your mood is not dependent on your conditions.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Margaret Thatcher,** former Prime Minister of the UK, on the connection between action and satisfaction:

“Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything to do and you've done it.”

​II.

Philosopher **Alan Watts** on mistakes:

“Regard yourself as a cloud, in the flesh, because you see, clouds never make mistakes. Did you ever see a cloud that was misshapen? Did you ever see a badly designed wave? No, they always do the right thing. But, if you will, treat yourself for a while as a cloud or a wave and realize that you can’t make a mistake whatever you do. Because even if you do something that appears totally disastrous, it will all come out in the wash somehow or another. Then through this capacity you will develop a kind of confidence. And through confidence you will be able to trust your own intuition.”
