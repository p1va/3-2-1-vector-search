# 3-2-1: On what it takes to be consistent, how to make a bad situation worse, and noticing small joys

## 3 Ideas From Me

In today's issue, I'm sharing three ideas to help you stick with better habits as we head deeper into January…

I.

“Nearly everything awesome takes longer than you think.

Get started and don't worry about the clock.”

​II.

“In theory, consistency is about being disciplined, determined, and unwavering.

In practice, consistency is about being adaptable. Don't have much time? Scale it down. Don't have much energy? Do the easy version. Find different ways to show up depending on the circumstances. Let your habits change shape to meet the demands of the day.

Adaptability is the way of consistency.”

III.

“A surefire way to make a bad situation worse is to continue replaying it in your mind.

The damage is done. The only thing that matters now is making the best choice given your current position.

Next play mentality.”

## 2 Quotes From Others

I.

Singer, songwriter, and actress **Dolly Parton** on gratitude:

“I make a point to appreciate all the little things in my life, because I learned early that if you don't, you get disappointed a lot. If you do, you might be pleasantly surprised quite often.

I go out and smell the air after a good, hard rain. I re-read passages from my favorite books. I hold the little treasures that somebody special gave me. By keeping my eyes open for unexpected joys, I find the world gives back more than we sometimes think.”

​II.

Software engineer **Marissa Mayer,** who was an early employee at Google and eventually became CEO of Yahoo, on how she grew throughout her career:

“I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow — when there's that moment of, ‘Wow, I'm really not sure I can do this,' and you push through.”
