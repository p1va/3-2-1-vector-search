# 3-2-1: On systems vs. goals, identity-based habits, and the lessons of life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Your goal is your desired outcome. Your system is the collection of daily habits that will get you there.

This year, spend less time focusing on outcomes and more time focusing on the habits that precede the results.”

For more on this concept, read [Atomic Habits](https://atomichabits.com/).

II.

“Your identity can hold you back:

-I'm terrible with directions.  
-I have a sweet tooth.  
-I'm bad at math.

…or build you up:

-I'm the type of person who doesn't miss workouts.  
-I finish what I start.  
-I read every day.

Build habits that reinforce your desired identity.”

III.

For my final thought, another quote from [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits):

“Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.”
