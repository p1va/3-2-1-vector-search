# 3-2-1: On managing expectations, and the importance of trial and error

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Maintain a margin of safety. If your life is designed only to handle the expected challenges, then it will fall apart as soon as something unexpected happens to you. Always be stronger than you need to be. Leave room for the unexpected.”

​II.

“When you're in the middle of the work, set your expectations high. It's unlikely your performance will exceed the standard you set for yourself. High expectations encourage you to keep reaching and fulfill your potential.

Once the work is done, release yourself from your expectations. The fastest way to ruin a good outcome is to tell yourself that it's not good enough. Your expectations dictate your happiness more than your results.

Expectations can be helpful as a motivator and unhelpful as a measuring stick. Now that the work is done you can rest easy knowing you tried your best. You've already won.”

III.

“Many people have a hard time making decisions because they don't know what is important.

When you have a clear mission and you are completely sure what is important to you, most decisions become easy. Once you're fully committed, you don't need rules for how to spend your time. It's obvious which decision to make. It's clear what to prioritize.

Many people don't need productivity or time management advice. They need conviction.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Child development author **Joseph Chilton Pearce** reminds parents (and all leaders) of an important truth:

“What we are teaches the child far more than what we say, so we must be what we want our children to become.”

​II.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson** on the importance of trial and error as a way of living:

“Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better. What if they are a little coarse, and you may get your coat soiled or torn? What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled in the dirt once or twice. Up again, you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Imagine you are at the end of your life and you are granted the ability to repeat one day. Which period of your life do you choose to repeat? Which phase of life would you want to go back to? Does that tell you anything about how you should be spending your time today?
