​II.

“Your habits are how you embody a particular identity.

When you make your bed, you embody the identity of someone who is clean and organized. When you study, you embody the identity of someone who is studious.

What identity are you embodying today? Who are your habits helping you become?”

III.

“Most big, deeply satisfying accomplishments in life take at least five years to achieve. This can include building a business, cultivating a loving relationship, writing a book, getting in the best shape of your life, raising a family, and more.

Five years is a long time. It is much slower than most of us would like. If you accept the reality of slow progress, you have every reason to take action today. If you resist the reality of slow progress, five years from now you'll simply be five years older and still looking for a shortcut.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Leo Tolstoy** on the opinions of others:

“If you care too much about being praised, in the end you will not accomplish anything serious.

…

Let the judgments of others be the consequence of your deeds, not their purpose.”

​II.

Writer, artist, and podcast host **Debbie Millman** on happiness:

“You have to make your own happiness, wherever you are. Your job isn’t going to make you happy, your spouse isn’t going to make you happy, the weather isn’t going to make you happy…

You have to decide what you want, and you have to find that way of doing it, whether or not the outside circumstances are going to participate in your success…

You have to be able to create your own happiness, period. And if you can’t, then you need to find a good shrink who can help you figure out what it’s going to take.”
