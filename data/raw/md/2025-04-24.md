# 3-2-1: On how to handle idiots, pushing toward growth, and two types of choices in life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“You can't make time go faster or success come sooner. The only thing you can control is the next action.”

---

​II.

“Reminder: If someone is acting like an idiot, you can just move on and let them be wrong. You do not have a personal obligation to correct people who are committed to being stupid. Sure, sometimes you need to attempt to get on the same page, but usually you can simply reclaim your time and move on to more productive ventures.”

III.

“In some areas of life, your reputation is defined by your wins.

* Creative pursuits. One bestseller or hit song can erase the memory of the ones that didn't work.
* Entrepreneurship. People rarely remember your failed business ideas, only your winning ones.

In areas like these, your mistakes fade away and the breakthroughs last. But in other areas of life, your reputation is defined by your losses.

* Crime. You can drive safely 364 days a year, but one DUI changes everything.
* Ethics and morals. One unethical decision can ruin a reputation and destroy trust.

In areas like these, your mistakes linger and consistency is rewarded.

Some areas of life reward your best day. Others punish your worst day.   
Know which situation you're in, and you can better decide when to be risky and when to play it safe.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

An old **Latin proverb,** “Initium est dimidium facti”, reminds us of the timeless importance of simply beginning the task at hand:

“Once you've started, you're halfway there.”

​II.

Talk show host and television producer **Oprah Winfrey** on emphasizing gratitude:

“The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate. When you concentrate on what you have, you'll always end up having more.”
