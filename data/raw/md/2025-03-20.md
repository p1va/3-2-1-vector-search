# 3-2-1: How to help someone, the value of bad luck, and rewarding competence

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The way to help someone is not to critique what makes them smaller, but to encourage what makes them larger.”

---

​II.

“Even bad luck is a source of opportunity—but only if you live each day as if that is true.”

---

III.

“Each year, Steve Jobs would hold an annual meeting with the 100 most important people at Apple.

Crucially, these were not the top 100 executives, but rather the 100 people who were most important to the company that year. Jobs personally chose attendees based on their direct contribution, creativity, vision, and impact within the company, regardless of their official titles or positions.

I always loved the spirit of that practice. Competence over credentials.”
