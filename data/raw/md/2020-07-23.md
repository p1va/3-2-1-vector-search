II.

“Live with a bias toward action.

Ironically, this will teach you patience. When you take action each day, you learn the value of accumulating small improvements over time. You understand how daily habits compound.

Be impatient with your actions. Be patient with your results.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and entrepreneur **Kevin Kelly** on the value of friends:

“Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.”

II.

Scientist **Marie Curie** on the importance of self-improvement:

“You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful.”
