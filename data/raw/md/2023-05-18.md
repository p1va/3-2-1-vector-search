III.

“Be excited for people when they succeed.

When a friend or family member reaches an important milestone like getting a promotion or making their first sale or scoring acceptance into their desired program, celebrate it. Buy them a drink. Send them a card. Tell them you're proud to know them.

Being thrilled on someone's behalf is a lovely way to be. Winning is better when shared.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **H. Jackson Brown Jr.** offers some life advice:

“Learn to listen. Opportunity sometimes knocks very softly.”

​II.

An email from **Steve Jobs**, sent to himself, remarking on how much we all need each other:

“I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing.

I speak a language I did not invent or refine.

I did not discover the mathematics I use.

I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself.

When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.

I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.

I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

If I do nothing, what will happen? If I act right now, what will happen?

Sometimes you need to let go. Sometimes you need to get going.
