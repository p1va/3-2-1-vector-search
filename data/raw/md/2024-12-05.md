​II.

“If you do not actively choose a better way, then society, culture, and the general inertia of life will push you into a worse way. The default is distraction, not improvement.”

III.

“You draw out of the world what you put into it.

Want to attract reliable people? Be reliable.   
Want to attract trustworthy people? Be trustworthy.   
Want to attract welcoming people? Be welcoming.   
Want to attract exceptional people? Be exceptional.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Journalist and author **Hunter S. Thompson** reminds us that we have the power to choose our path:

“It is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that — no one HAS to do something he doesn't want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that's what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You'll have lots of company.”

​II.

Roman scholar and philosopher **Marcus Tullius Cicero** on the value of making numerous attempts:

“For who is there who, shooting all day, will not sometimes hit the mark?”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

The common narrative is that kids learn faster than adults, but if you watch any toddler they spend a large portion of the day attempting things that are on the edge of their ability.

How much time have you spent on the edge of your ability today?
