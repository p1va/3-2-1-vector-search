# 3-2-1: On the power of inputs, what holds quiet power over you, and the one habit that matters most

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The quality of your thoughts is determined by the quality of your reading. Spend more time thinking about the inputs.”

---

​II.

“To understand others, watch what they reward.

To understand yourself, watch what you envy.”

---

III.

“What you push down doesn’t vanish. It festers and wields quiet power over your thoughts and actions.

What needs to be addressed that isn’t currently being addressed?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Social media consultant **Charles Miller** on balance:

“Spend a handful of hours a day going fast. Crush a gym session. Do deep work on a project you care about. Spend the rest of the day going slow. Take walks. Read books. Get a long dinner with friends. Either way, avoid the anxious middle where you never truly relax or truly move forward.”

​II.

Architect and furniture designer **Eileen Gray** on thinking for yourself:

“To create, one must first question everything. Never adopt someone else's conclusion without putting it to the test of your own reasoning and imagination.”
