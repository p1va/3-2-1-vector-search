# 3-2-1: Thinking clearly, being bold, and making each day a masterpiece

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you'd like to do something bold with your life, you will have to choose to do something bold on a specific day.

There is no perfect day. There is no right time. For the trajectory to change, there has to be one day when you simply make the choice.”

​II.

“If someone has the courage to admit they were wrong, you should have the grace to give them credit for admitting it. Rubbing it in encourages them to never admit being wrong again.”

III.

“The more precisely you define the problem, the more easily you can find a solution.

“I feel bad” can have a million causes.

“I didn't sleep much last night and I haven't exercised in a week” has a very straightforward answer.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Rabbi, physician, and philosopher **Moses Maimonides** on thinking clearly:

“Accept the truth from whatever source it comes.”

​II.

Writer **Ralph Waldo Emerson** on making each day a masterpiece:

“Finish every day and be done with it. For manners and for wise living it is a vice to remember. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. This day for all that is good and fair. It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the rotten yesterdays.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

There is usually a block of time each day when you are at your best—​peak energy, peak enthusiasm. Let's say it's 2 hours per day. How do you spend those 2 hours? Who or what gets your best time?
