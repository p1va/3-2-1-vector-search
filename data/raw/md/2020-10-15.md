## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

III.

“The fastest way to improve is to learn from others.

* Read good books
* Talk to people who have done it
* Soak up the lessons of the past

Learn from the experiments history has already run and you can start the race halfway finished.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

II.

Entrepreneur and investor **Sam Altman** on the importance of quality:

“All companies that grow really big do so in only one way: people recommend the product or service to other people. What this means is that if you want to be a great company some day, you have to eventually build something so good that people will recommend it to their friends—in fact, so good that they want to be the first one to recommend it to their friends for the implied good taste. No growth hack, brilliant marketing idea, or sales team can save you long term if you don't have a sufficiently good product.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Momentum is a double-edged sword. It can propel you to new heights or keep you locked into previous choices and old habits.

Where do I have healthy momentum right now? Where do I have unhealthy momentum?
