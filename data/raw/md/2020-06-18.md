# 3-2-1: On the cycle of improvement, self-doubt, and building a spirit

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The Paradox of Freedom:

The way to expand your freedom is to narrow your focus.

Stay focused on saving to achieve financial freedom.

Stay focused on training to achieve physical freedom.

Stay focused on learning to achieve intellectual freedom.”

III.

“The Cycle of Improvement:

1. Awareness – identify what you need to improve.

2. Deliberate practice – focus your conscious effort on the specific area you want to improve.

3. Habit – with practice, the effortful becomes automatic.

4. Repeat – begin again.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

NBA superstar **Michael Jordan** on self-doubt**:**

“Why would I think about missing a shot that I haven’t taken yet?”

II.

Author **Anna Quindlen** on building a spirit:

“There are thousands of people out there with the same degree you have; when you get a job, there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you are the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just your life at a desk, or your life on the bus, or in the car, or at the computer. Not just the life of your mind, but the life of your heart. Not just your bank account, but your soul.

People don’t talk about the soul very much anymore. It’s so much easier to write a résumé than to craft a spirit. But a résumé is cold comfort on a winter night, or when you’re sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you’ve gotten back the chest X ray and it doesn’t look so good, or when the doctor writes “prognosis, poor.”

… You cannot be really first-rate at your work if your work is all you are.“
