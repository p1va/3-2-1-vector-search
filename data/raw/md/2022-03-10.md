## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“What starts as an excuse can easily become a habit.

Don't let a bad day become a lifestyle.”

​II.

“Life is a series of seasons, and what works in one season may not work in the next.

What season are you in right now? What habits does that season require?”

III.

“Awareness is often enough to motivate change.

Simply tracking your food intake will motivate you to alter it. Merely writing down your problems may spark ideas for possible solutions.

The process starts with seeing reality clearly.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet **May Sarton** on the importance of rest:

“I always forget how important the empty days are, how important it may be sometimes not to expect to produce anything, even a few lines in a journal. A day when one has not pushed oneself to the limit seems a damaged, damaging day, a sinful day. Not so! The most valuable thing one can do for the psyche, occasionally, is to let it rest, wander, live in the changing light of a room.”

​II.

Computer programmer **Erik Naggum** on reaching up instead of punching down:

“The secret to feeling great about yourself is not to be found in searching for people who are less than you and then show yourself superior to them, but in searching for people who are more than you and then show yourself worthy of their company.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Write down all the projects you are working on right now. What is the one thing that, if you had the courage to eliminate it entirely, would make all the others easier?
