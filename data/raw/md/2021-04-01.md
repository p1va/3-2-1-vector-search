# 3-2-1: On mentors, margin of safety, and how to say no

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Fear of failure is higher when you're not working on the problem.

If you are taking action, you are less worried about failure because you realize you can influence the outcome.”

​II.

“You can often learn more from peers who are 2 years ahead of you than mentors who are 20 years ahead of you.

Life evolves and most insights get outdated.”

---

III.

“Maintain a margin of safety—even when it’s going well.

Rich people go bankrupt chasing even more wealth.

Fit people get injured chasing personal records.

Productive people become ineffective taking on too many projects.

Don’t let your ambition ruin your position.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Grace Bonney** on how to get better at saying no:

“The biggest fear most of us have with learning to say no is that we will miss an opportunity. An opportunity that would have catapulted us to success, or that will never come again. And most of the time, that simply isn’t true.  
​  
I’ve found that the first part of learning to say no is learning to accept that offers and opportunities are merely an indication that you’re on the right path—not that you’ve arrived at a final destination you can never find again.  
​  
If someone is choosing you, it means you’re doing something right. And that is the biggest opportunity you can receive—the chance to recognize that your hard work is paying off. And if you continue to do good work, those opportunities will continue—and improve—over time.”

​II.

Former First Lady **Eleanor Roosevelt** on considering what you value most:

“To be mature you have to realize what you value most.

It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity. They seem never to have paused to consider what has value for them. They spend great effort and sometimes make great sacrifices for values that, fundamentally, meet no real needs of their own. Perhaps they have imbibed the values of their particular profession or job, of their community or their neighbors, of their parents or family.

Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one’s own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for.”
