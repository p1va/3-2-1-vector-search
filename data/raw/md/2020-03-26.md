II.

“Anticipate, but don’t expect.

Anticipation: You’re excited for what the future holds, but you don’t try to control it.

Expectation: You try to predict the future and restrict your happiness to one outcome.

Always be excited about the possibilities. Never be entitled to them.”

Work as if you can solve anything.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Eugene Schwartz**, the mastermind behind many brilliant advertising campaigns, on how to write a good ad:

“Let’s get right down to the heart of the matter. The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself and not from the copy.

Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already existing desires onto a particular product.

This is the copywriter's task: not to create this mass desire — but to channel and direct it.”

II.

**Esther Perel**, a psychotherapist and relationship expert, on her definition of love:

“[Love] is a verb. It’s an active engagement with all kinds of feelings—positive ones and primitive ones and loathsome ones. But it’s a very active verb. And it’s often surprising how it can kind of ebb and flow. It’s like the moon. We think it’s disappeared, and suddenly it shows up again. It’s not a permanent state of enthusiasm.”
