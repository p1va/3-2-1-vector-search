II.

“When people say they don’t want to change what they really mean is they don’t have an incentive to change.

Change the incentives and the behavior follows suit.”

III.

“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your identity.

This is why habits are crucial. They cast repeated votes for being a certain type of person.”

*Note: For more on this idea, see Chapter 2 of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).*

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Astronaut **Mae Jemison**on belonging:

“Once I got into space, I was feeling very comfortable in the universe. I felt like I had a right to be anywhere in this universe, that I belonged here as much as any speck of stardust, any comet, any planet.”

*Source: [Then & Now: Dr. Mae Jemison](https://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/01/07/cnn25.tan.jemison/)*

II.

Author **James Baldwin** on change:

“Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”

*Source: This quote comes from an unfinished draft of a book manuscript by James Baldwin. It was discovered when film director Raoul Peck got access to the manuscript and shared the quote in his documentary, I Am Not Your Negro.*
