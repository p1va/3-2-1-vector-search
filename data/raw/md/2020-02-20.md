# 3-2-1: On failure, the importance of teaching, and handling the expectations of others

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“When failure is expensive, plan carefully.

When failure is cheap, act quickly.”

II.

“The person who learns the most in any classroom is the teacher.

If you really want to learn a topic, then “teach” it. Write a book. Teach a class. Build a product. Start a company.

The act of making something will force you to learn more deeply than reading ever will.”

III.

“Do not wait. If there is something you wish to do, go do it.

Death comes for busy people too. It will not pause and return at a more convenient time.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The Chinese inventor and author, **Lin Yutang**, on focus:

“Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials.”

II.

The brilliant physicist and Nobel Prize winner, **Richard Feynman,** on dealing with the expectations of others:

“You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish.

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Whose expectations am I trying to fulfill? My own or those of someone else?
