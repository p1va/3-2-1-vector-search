I.

“Your problems adjust to their true level of importance after a hard workout and a good night of sleep.”

​II.

“If you want to be rich, then be kind.

It’s hard to create wealth unless you work well with others, and it's hard to work well with others if you are unlikable.

Even if you can build wealth without kindness, rich jerks end up poor in friendship. You can buy friends, but not good ones.”

III.

“A phrase I heard recently and found useful: I agree with the idea, but I disagree with the tone.

Many ideas get dismissed because they are delivered in a cocky or hostile or dismissive tone—or because of who delivers them.

Separate substance from style.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Scientist and systems engineer, **Donella Meadows**, on intellectual humility and learning from others:

“Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.”

​II.

Attorney and poet, **Max Ehrmann**, offers some words for life:

“You are a child of the universe,  
no less than the trees and the stars;  
you have a right to be here.  
And whether or not it is clear to you,  
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,  
it is still a beautiful world.  
Be cheerful.  
Strive to be happy.”
