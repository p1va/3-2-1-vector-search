# 3-2-1: On taking lots of shots, the power of concentration, and savoring the path to success

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Work hard on what comes easily.”

​II.

“Use the best idea you have right now. Claiming you need to ‘learn more' or ‘get your ducks in a row' is just a crutch that prevents you from starting. Education is a lifelong pursuit. You will always need to learn more. It's not a reason to wait.”

III.

“One study looked at artists who started at the bottom and worked their way to successful careers. The researchers identified one factor that was consistent across the group: they performed far more shows than the average artist.

The same principle holds true in many fields. If you want to rise, you need a lot of shots on goal. Keep showing up. Keep making new material. Eventually, you catch a lucky break.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Priest and philosopher **Desiderius Erasmus** reminds us of the power of concentrating on a single target:

“He who chases two hares catches neither.”

​II.

Writer **Harold V. Melchert** reminds us that success is sweeter when you savor the path:

“Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly; steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey.”
