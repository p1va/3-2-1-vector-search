# 3-2-1: My advice for writers, what silence says, and the chapters of your life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“A truth unsaid can still be felt.

What needs to be discussed, but hasn't been said yet?

Clear the air.”

​II.

“My friend, who sometimes shares his writing with me, once said my feedback always falls into three categories:

1. Make it shorter.

2. Make it more appealing.

3. How could it apply to more people?”

III.

“Some people get addicted to chain-smoking their problems. They spend all day going from sorrow to sorrow. It doesn't have to be that way. You can live each day going from joy to joy—like a sunflower that turns to face the sun as it moves across the sky. It's not about having a problem-free life, but about focusing on the light. Sunflowers still have shadows, but they are always behind them.”
