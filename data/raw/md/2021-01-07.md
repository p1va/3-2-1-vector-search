# 3-2-1: On maturity, how to do exceptional work, and the connectedness of things

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Maturity is learning how to start when you feel like procrastinating and learning how to listen when you feel like talking.”

II.

“Solve big problems early.

Rebound after one missed workout, not a decade of inactivity.

Repair a strained relationship the next day, not years later.

Fix overspending before it becomes a lifestyle.

Problems with simple solutions at first become difficult to unwind over time.”

---

III.

“There are nearly endless opportunities to improve each day and finding them largely boils down to being curious.

People who are better in the end are usually curious in the beginning.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Morten Hansen** offers an alternative way to do exceptional work:

“Instead of asking how many tasks you can tackle given your working hours, ask how many you can ditch given what you must do to excel.”

II.

The painter **Antoni Tapies** on the connectedness of things:

“Take a look at the simplest of objects. Let's take, for example, an old chair. It seems like nothing.

But think of the universe comprised within it: the sweaty hands cutting the wood that used to be a robust tree, full of energy, in the middle of a luxuriant forest by some high mountains. The loving work that built it, the joyful anticipation of the one who bought it, the tired bodies it has helped, the pains and the joys it must have endured, whether in fancy halls or in a humble dining room in your neighborhood.

Everything, everything shares life and has its importance! Even the most worn down of chair carries inside the initial force of the sap climbing from the earth, out there in the forest, and will still be useful the day when, broken into kindling, it burns in some fireplace.”
