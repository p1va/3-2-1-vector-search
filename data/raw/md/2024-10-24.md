# 3-2-1: On the biggest barrier to learning, powerful self-talk strategies, and the ripples we leave behind

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Ideas that are hoarded help no one. Success follows generosity.”

​II.

“In many cases, you'll find the only thing preventing you from learning is your ego.

No one enjoys feeling foolish, but attempting something new requires that you climb down from your perch and struggle as a beginner. You must ask questions that reveal your ignorance or attempt skills that make you look uncoordinated.

Learning demands the willingness to live in a brief state of discomfort. You must believe that looking like a fool for an hour will not ruin your reputation for life.”

III.

“Self-talk strategies:

If you need confidence, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend.

If you need persistence, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a student.

If you need patience, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a child.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Graphic designer and illustrator **Seymour Chwast** reminds us that working harder may not be the answer:

“If you dig a hole and it's in the wrong place, digging it deeper isn't going to help.”

​II.

Author **Terry Pratchett** on the ripples we leave behind:

“No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away, until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone's life is only the core of their actual existence.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Forget about the outcome and focus on what precedes it.

Am I putting myself in good positions and creating the conditions for success?
