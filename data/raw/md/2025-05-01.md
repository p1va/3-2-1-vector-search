# 3-2-1: On making the most of what you have, how to make a convincing argument, and embracing danger

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The more control you have over your attention, the more control you have over your future. And it starts with having enough courage to protect your time.

It's so easy to say yes. We want to be agreeable, helpful, liked. That's how time disappears and attention becomes fragmented: not in big chunks, but in a thousand small concessions.

What you trade your attention for is what your life becomes.”

​II.

“Not everything blooms in spring. Your season might be autumn.

Keep going.”

---

III.

“Someone will start with more money than you. Someone will get into a better school. Someone will inherit connections you need to build from scratch. Someone will get picked before you. In other words, you’ll have no problem finding people with a head start.

That’s not the point.

The point is: when you get your opportunity, you make the most of it.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and computer scientist **Gurwinder Bhogal** on how to make a convincing argument:

“We assume that the more arguments we give, the better our case. In reality, our weakest arguments dilute the strongest. Generally, you’ll only be as convincing as your worst point, so instead of making as many arguments as you can, make only the best.”

​II.

The painter **Vincent van Gogh** on fear and risk:

“Fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm fearsome, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. They leave that wisdom to those to whom it appeals. When the storm comes — when night falls — what's worse: the danger or the fear of danger? Give me reality, the danger itself.”
