# 3-2-1:On thinking like a scientist, how to stand out from the crowd, and what wisdom looks like

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Worrying about the future is like watching a leaf fall and trying to predict where it will land. Stop trying to guess where the wind will blow and get to work.”

---

​II.

“Treat failure like a scientist.

Each attempt is an experiment. Each mistake is a clue.

You're not failing. You're refining.”

---

III.

“One way to stand out is to look for pockets of low competition.

Wake up early—less traffic, fewer people.

Go deeper or narrower in your field—less noise, more space.

People are drawn to where it is crowded. Look for the quiet spaces inside your areas of interest. Excellence often hides at the edges.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and philosopher **Michel de Montaigne** reveals what wisdom looks like:

“The most certain sign of wisdom is cheerfulness.”

​II.

Poet and novelist **Hermann Hesse** on remaining open and receptive to what the world is offering you:

“When someone is seeking, it happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal…

For in striving towards your goal, you do not see many things that are under your nose.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

The cost of convenience is vitality. You can have a lot of things done for you in the modern world — and many of them are great time savers! — but the feeling of being alive comes from being fully engaged in the right task, not free from all tasks.

Sure, you can automate and delegate all sorts of things, but the more interesting question is, “What fills you with so much liveliness that you want to do the work yourself?”
