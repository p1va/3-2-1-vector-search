​II.

“One of the most critical skills in life—and yet never taught in school—is choosing where to direct your attention.

III.

“Money plays an important role in life, but it can't be the only filter for how you decide to spend your time. Nobody will ever pay you to go on a date with your spouse or take your kids to the park or grab coffee with your parents.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Carl Jung,** the influential psychiatrist, on the value of knowing yourself:

​II.

Philosopher and writer **Sir Roger Scruton** on the importance of building beautiful things:

“There is a deep human need for beauty, and if you ignore that need in architecture, your buildings will not last, since people will never feel at home in them.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Today's question is a two-parter:

When I'm living a good day, what am I spending my time on?

Do the sources of information I am exposed to each day support that type of lifestyle or distract from it?
