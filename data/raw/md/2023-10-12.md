# 3-2-1: Two rules for life, the power of reputation, and the peace of wild things

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Two of my rules for life:

1. The person who has the most fun wins.

2. The climb is the fun part.”

​II.

“Your reputation is your most important asset. It precedes you before you walk into the room and lingers long after the work is done.”

III.

“Big wins tend to be accompanied by some combination of bigger decisions, more uncertainty, and greater risk.

If you want to play at a higher level, you need to be comfortable with greater swings of highs and lows: mentally, emotionally, financially.

You can avoid the swings, but you might be forced to play at a lower level.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Laura Ingalls Wilder**

“The real things haven’t changed. It is still best to be honest and truthful; to make the most of what we have; to be happy with simple pleasures; and have courage when things go wrong.”

*Source:* [​*Laura's Letter to Children*​](http://www.liwfrontiergirl.com/letter.html)

​II.

**Wendell Berry**

“When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Look back ten years and you can probably identify a few blind spots or mistaken beliefs you held at the time. Now, fast forward ten years from today… what are likely to be your current blind spots? What are you not spending enough time thinking about or perhaps even willfully ignoring?
