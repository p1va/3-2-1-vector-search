# 3-2-1: On having high standards, the secret to willpower, and how to be strong yet flexible

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“One easy way to show you care about others is to ask them questions about their life.

* What are they excited about?
* What are they working on?
* What are they hoping for?

Simply asking the question and listening thoughtfully is an act of generosity. You're giving them the gift of attention.”

“Whatever you're doing, do it well. If you're writing a thank you note, take an extra minute to mention something beyond the typical thank you. If you're exercising, do each set as well as you can. If you're in conversation, really listen and don't just wait for your turn to talk.

Having high standards adds up. You can nearly always find an extra minute to do it better. And most important, you prove to yourself that you're the type of person who does things well.”

III.

“In the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will never beat your environment. The more disciplined your environment is, the less disciplined you need to be. Don't swim upstream.”

​II.

In a single sentence, author **Virginia Woolf** encourages us to live with a strong foundation — to know our values and be grounded in a strong sense of self — but to remain adaptable and open to life:

“I am rooted, but I flow.”
