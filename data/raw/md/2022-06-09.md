“Two of the key questions in life: How do I grow? How do I manage risk?

You need to do both if you wish to survive and excel.”

“Speed is important. Work fast and iterate. People rarely remember the first draft, but everyone remembers the final draft.

Speed is unimportant. People rarely remember how long it took you to do the job, but everyone remembers how well you did the job.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The ancient Greek poet **Hesiod** on small improvements:

“If you add only a little to a little and do this often, soon that little will become great.”

​II.

**Lillian Moore** shares a quick story that reveals what really motivates people:

“A few months after my husband and I moved to a small Massachusetts town I grumbled to a resident about the poor service at the library, hoping she would repeat my complaints to the librarian. The next time I went to the library, the librarian had set aside two bestsellers for me and a new biography for my husband. What's more, she appeared to be genuinely glad to see me.

Later I reported the miraculous change to my friend. “I suppose you told her how poor we thought the service was?” I asked.

“No,” she confessed. “In fact—I hope you don't mind—I told her your husband was amazed at the way she had built up this small town library, and that you thought she showed unusually good taste in the new books she ordered.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

The generalist becomes more powerful when they develop a specialty where they can apply their broad insight.

The specialist becomes more powerful when they develop a broader surface area of knowledge to connect with their expertise.

Which side are you favoring right now? Would you benefit from a broader area to apply your already honed skills? Or do you need deeper skills to unlock your general knowledge?
