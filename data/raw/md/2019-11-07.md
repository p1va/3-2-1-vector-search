# 3-2-1: On social pressure, the power of choice, and the price of success

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you want to take something more seriously, do it publicly.

Publishing an article pressures you to think clearly. Competing in a race pressures you to train consistently. Presenting on any topic pressures you to learn it.

Social pressure forces you to up your game.”

---

II.

“Your choices create leverage. Your habits unleash leverage.

A good initial choice (like choosing the right thing to work on or the right person to work with) can deliver 100x payoff. However, if you don't have great habits, then great choices are just potential energy.

Ideally, you'll have both.”

III.

“Most failures are one-time costs. Most regrets are recurring costs.

The pain of inaction stings longer than the pain of incorrect action.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Today, I'd like to share two quotes that pair well together…

I.

**Scott Adams**, author and creator of the Dilbert comic strip, on the price of success:

“If you want to be successful, find out what the price is and then pay it.”

II.

Writer **Rudyard Kipling** also on the price of success:

“If you don't get what you want, it's a sign either that you did not seriously want it, or that you tried to bargain over the price.”
