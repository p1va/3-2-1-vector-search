“A brief guide to leadership:

* Always know the answer to, “What are we optimizing for?”
* Recruit. Recruit. Recruit.
* Never ask someone to do something you aren’t willing to do yourself.
* Give away the credit. Take the blame.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Brene Brown** on when to value feedback:

“If you’re not in the arena also getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback. If you have constructive feedback you want to give me, I want it… But if you’re in the cheap seats, not putting yourself on the line, and just talking about how I can do it better, I’m in no way interested in your feedback.”

II.

**Ed Catmull**, cofounder of Pixar, on how they make great movies:

“Initially, the films we put together, they're a mess. It's like everything else in life—the first time you do it, it's a mess. Sometimes it's labeled … “a failure” … but that's not even the right word to use. It's just like, you get the first one out, you learn from it, and the only failure is if you don't learn from it, if you don't progress.”
