## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Your first task is to find what feels effortless to you.

Your second task is to put maximum effort into it.”

​II.

A reminder from [​Atomic Habits​](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits):

“Time will multiply whatever you feed it.

Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.”

III.

“Things that keep talented people from fulfilling their potential:

* Trying to please everyone
* Imitating the desires of others
* Chasing status without questioning why
* Playing superhero and trying to do it all alone
* Dividing attention between too many projects

Which one is most likely to pull you in?”
