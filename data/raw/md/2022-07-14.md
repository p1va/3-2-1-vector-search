“Most of the embarrassing moments of my life happened when I wanted to say no, but ended up saying yes (or saying nothing at all).

Most of the missed opportunities in my life happened when I wanted to say yes, but ended up saying no (or saying nothing at all).”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Amelia Earhart,** the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, on preparation and worry:

“The time to worry is three months before a flight. Decide then whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying. To worry is to add another hazard.”

​II.

Marine biologist and writer, **Rachel Carson,** on parenting, education, and the thirst for knowledge:

“I sincerely believe that for the child, and for the parent seeking to guide him, it is not half so important to know as to feel.

If facts are the seeds that later produce knowledge and wisdom, then the emotions and the impressions of the senses are the fertile soil in which the seeds must grow. The years of early childhood are the time to prepare the soil. Once the emotions have been aroused — a sense of the beautiful, the excitement of the new and the unknown, a feeling of sympathy, pity, admiration or love — then we wish for knowledge about the subject of our emotional response. Once found, it has lasting meaning.

It is more important to pave the way for the child to want to know than to put him on a diet of facts he is not ready to assimilate.”
