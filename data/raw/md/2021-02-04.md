# 3-2-1: On teaching, mastery, and working on important problems

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“It took me…  
​  
200+ articles before I got a book deal.  
250+ articles before I got major media coverage.  
100+ interviews before my book hit the bestseller list.  
​  
You need a lot of shots on goal. Not everything will work, but some of it will.  
​  
Keep shooting.”

“The challenge for anyone interested in making progress is to simultaneously have (1) the confidence to go after what you want and (2) the humility to accept who you are right now and (3) the willingness to build skills that bridge the gap between 1 and 2.”

III.

“Where to focus:

For the beginner, execution.

For the intermediate, strategy.

For the expert, mindset.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The art historian **Gustav Friedrich Waagen**on how to teach so people learn:

“First delight, then instruct.”

​II.

Aikido instructor **George Leonard** on mastery:

​”How long will it take me to master Aikido?” a prospective student asks.

“How long do you expect to live?” is the only respectable response.

Ultimately, practice is the path of mastery. If you stay on it long enough, you’ll find it to be a vivid place, with its ups and downs, is challenges and comforts, its surprises, disappointments, and unconditional joys. You’ll take your share of bumps and bruises while traveling – bruises of the ego as well as of the body, mind and spirit – but it might well turn out to be the most reliable thing in your life. Then, too, it might eventually make you a winner in your chosen field, if that’s what you’re looking for, and then people will refer to you as a master. But that’s not really the point.

What is mastery? At the heart of it, mastery is practice. Mastery is staying on the path.”
