# 3-2-1: On increasing intelligence, networking, and shooting for the top

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Qualities that lead to increasing intelligence:

1. The curiosity to experiment and explore.  
2. The honesty to observe the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.  
3. The humility to kill your favorite ideas when you learn something new.  
4. The consistency to repeat this cycle for life.”

“The most effective networking strategy I’ve found has nothing to do with conferences, cocktail hours, cold emails, or any of the common ideas you hear.

1) Do interesting things.  
2) Share them publicly.

Repeat those two strategies and you'll become a magnet. Like-minded people will come to you.”

III.

“In the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will never beat your environment.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Tim Grover** was the athletic trainer used by Michael Jordan (and many elite NBA players). Here he is describing the three things he asks of every player:

“I don't care how much you can lift, how fast you can run, how many pull-ups you can do, or whether you can hit a three while blindfolded. There are only three things I ask of every client… Show up, work hard, and listen. That's it. It requires no talent, no special genetics, or any skill whatsoever to show up, work hard, and listen.”

He adds:

“When I train my athletes, it's a dictatorship with three rules: show up, work hard, and listen. If you can do those three things, I can help you. If you can't we have no use for each other. I will bust my ass for you every way possible, but I expect you to do the same for yourself. I'm not going to work harder than you do for your benefit. Show me you want it, and I'll give it to you.”

II.

The author **Ursula K. Le Guin** on shooting for the top:

Interviewer: “Against whom were you measuring your work?”

Le Guin: “Charles Dickens. Jane Austen. And then, when I finally learned to read her, Virginia Woolf. Shoot for the top, always. You know you’ll never make it, but what’s the fun if you don’t shoot for the top?”
