​II.

“It generally feels better to run toward something than to run away from something. Focus on what is pulling you in, not what you're trying to avoid.”

III.

“It's easier to notice when you lose money than when you lose time. Be sure you're making the trade you want.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet and teacher **June Jordan** on perspective:

“Our earth is round, and, among other things, that means that you and I can hold completely different points of view and both be right. The difference of our positions will show stars in your window I cannot even imagine. Your sky may burn with light, while mine, at the same moment, spreads beautiful to darkness. Still we must choose how we separately corner the circling universe of our experience. Once chosen, our cornering will determine the message of any star and darkness we encounter.”

​II.

Novelist **Madeline Miller** offers a more poetic way to say I love you:

“I would recognize you in total darkness, were you mute and I deaf. I would recognize you in another lifetime entirely, in different bodies, different times. And I would love you in all of this, until the very last star in the sky burnt out into oblivion.”
