​II.

“Frankly, the most valuable items in our house might be a squat rack, a bench, and a set of weights. I thought I was purchasing gym equipment, but I was actually buying peace of mind.”

III.

“Pay attention to how readily people talk themselves out of things—and be wary of adopting the same narrative. People will often try to convince you their limiting beliefs should become your own. They do not. Find your own ceiling.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist and writer **Marguerite Yourcenar** on helping others become who they are and not who we want them to be:

“Our great mistake is to try to exact from each person virtues which he does not possess, and to neglect the cultivation of those which he has.”

​II.

Executive performance coach **Julie Gurner** on the power of better questions:

“The questions you ask yourself will largely determine the answers you get.

* “Why am I not successful?” You'll get answers that berate you.
* “How can I succeed here?” You'll get answers that push you.

Be deliberate in the questions you ask yourself.”
