# 3-2-1: On the power of relationships, practicing mental toughness, and a little secret of life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Start with the best opportunity available to you. If you make the most of what you have in front of you right now, better opportunities will become available as you go along.”

---

​II.

“Relationships are usually the most important thing.

If you want to achieve more, there is some relationship that can unlock better results. If you want to make a meaningful contribution, helping others is a great way to do it. If you simply want to be a little happier, life is often more fun when shared with someone.

Whatever you're trying to accomplish, relationships are probably the key to getting there. Take this idea seriously and spend a little time thinking about which relationships you need to build or invest in.”

III.

“Mental toughness is often framed as the perseverance that gets you across the finish line:

* Find a way to make it happen
* Push through the pain
* Grind it out to the end

But most days, mental toughness isn't about crossing the finish line. It's about getting to the starting line:

* Show up when no one is watching
* Keep your eye on the ball
* Do a little bit every day

Mental toughness is not skipping the days that are easy to skip.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Jesuit priest **Anthony de Mello** reminds us to focus on the magic in front of us:

“Think of yourself in a concert hall listening to the strains of the sweetest music when you suddenly remember that you forgot to lock your car. You are anxious about the car, you cannot walk out of the hall and you cannot enjoy the music. There you have a perfect image of life as it is lived by most human beings.”

​II.

Poet **Ellen Sturgis Hooper** reveals a little secret of life:

“I slept, and dreamed that life was joy;

I woke, and found that life was service.

I acted and behold, service was joy.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

There's a difference between feeling tired and feeling empty. One probably needs sleep. The other may need purpose.

Are you low on rest or low on meaning?
