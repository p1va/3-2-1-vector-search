# 3-2-1: On avoiding frustration, easier paths to a good life, and the power of not reading

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Chase your desired lifestyle, not your desired title. People are blinded by status and labels. Once you release the need for a specific title, there is almost always an easier path to living your preferred lifestyle.”

---

​II.

“Take great care to avoid mistakes when the decision is hard to reverse.

But! If you make a mistake that is hard to reverse, there is no sense beating yourself up about it. Your responsibility is to make the best next choice given your current position. You must always make the most of the situation you are in.

Next play mentality.”

---

III.

“Many frustrations are the result of unspoken expectations. Before you get too annoyed, make sure you are clearly expressing your thoughts.”

Animator and cartoonist **Walt Kelly** reminds us that a lot of hard work is wasted:

“Having lost sight of our objectives, we redoubled our efforts.”

​II.

Philosopher **Arthur Schopenhauer** encourages us to read what is important, not what is popular:

“The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. – A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It is common to think about what you would like to accomplish. It is less common to think about what must be discarded to make space for your new endeavors. The time must come from somewhere. What do you need to give up to make space for what you would like to achieve?
