# 3-2-1: On the root cause of poor decisions, how things stick, and a simple equation for success

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Lessons are unlikely to stick unless they are repeated.

Behaviors are unlikely to stick unless they are repeated.

Love is unlikely to stick unless it is repeated.

The practice solidifies.”

​II.

“Many of the moments when you think, ‘*I wish I had handled that better,'* or ‘*I should have seen that more clearly,'* aren't really about poor judgment. Often, the root cause is either rushing through the task or skipping basic self-care.

Get an extra hour of sleep. Stop trying to do so many things at once. Go for a walk or get a little exercise. Take a breath and actually think for a minute.

You can do a few things well. You can't do everything well. If you keep scattering your attention across seven different priorities, you'll keep making mistakes that your rested and thoughtful mind would never make.”

A simple equation [​Brandon Webb​](https://brandontwebb.substack.com/) shared with me this week:

“Failure + reflection + another rep = competence.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**Charles F. Brannan,** former United States Secretary of Agriculture, on the magic of sharing what you know:

“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”

​II.

Writer **Divya Venn** on the inconvenience of relationships:

“Being annoyed is the price you pay for community. It means having guests when you'd rather be alone. It means letting someone live with you even when they get on your nerves. It means showing up for events that you'd rather not go to. It means turning the other cheek.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

A two-part question for today:

Where am I rushing right now when I should be moving deliberately?

Where am I dragging my feet right now when I should be moving fast?

Until next week,
