​II.

“When researching strategies, emphasize patterns over stories. One person succeeding means nothing. 100 people succeeding is a signal.

When explaining strategies, emphasize stories over patterns. People forget numbers and charts. Everyone remembers a great story.”

III.

“When determining the size or complexity of a new habit ask yourself, “What can I stick to—even on my worst day?”

Start there. Master the art of showing up. Then advance.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Painter **Georgia O'Keeffe** on making the most of what you have:

“Where I was born and where and how I have lived is unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest.”

​II.

Poet **Jenny Xie** on how reading is a form of travel:

“Reading is migratory, an act of transport, from one life to another, one mind to another. Just like geographic travel, reading involves estrangement that comes with the process of dislocating from a familiar context. I gather energy from this kind of movement, this estranging and unsettling, and I welcome it precisely because it’s conducive to examination, interrogation, reordering. Travel, imaginative or physical, can sharpen perception and force a measuring of distance and difference.”
