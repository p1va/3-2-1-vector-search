# 3-2-1: On the power of boredom, why being right is not enough, and how to develop confidence

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Boredom is a filter. Common ideas come before it. Uncommon ideas come after it. Sit with a project long enough to get bored with it, then sit a little more. The most useful insights bubble up after you get bored.”

---

​II.

“People often care about belonging more than they care about accuracy. We don't always believe things because they are factually correct. In many cases, we cling to beliefs that make us look good to the people we care about.”

---

III.

“The only way to develop true confidence is to earn it.

* The confidence that you can bounce back from failure is earned by working through previous failures.
* The confidence that you can deliver the speech is earned by the previous speeches you have given.
* The confidence that you can perform on game day is earned by the previous performances in practice.

In the beginning, you need enough courage to practice even though it may not go very well. And over time, as your skills improve, courage transforms into confidence. Courage first, confidence later.”

**Bill Bernbach,** founder of advertising agency DDB, reminds us that it is not enough to be right — you must also be compelling:

“A dull truth will not be looked at. An exciting lie will. That is what good, sincere people must understand. They must make their truth exciting and new, or their good works will be born dead.”
