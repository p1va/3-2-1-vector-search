​II.

“Revising a book before it is published is incredibly useful. The extra polish improves the first impression.

Publishing a second edition a few years after publishing, even if it involves the same revisions, is less useful. The brand has already been established.

Refine at the right time.”

III.

“Two truths that can be at odds:

1) There are no bonus points in life for doing it the hard way.  
2) There is a lot to be gained in life by acting fast and giving your best effort.

Don't let the excuse of searching for a better way prevent you from taking action.”

## 2 Quotes From Others

I.

Author **Shakti Gawain** on living authentically:

“Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier.

The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then, do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.”

​II.

**Henry Ford,** founder of Ford Motor Company, on the importance of giving value before you ask for value:

“I quit my job on August 15, 1899, and went into the automobile business…

The most surprising feature of business as it was conducted was the large attention given to finance and the small attention to service. That seemed to me to be reversing the natural process which is that the money should come as the result of work and not before the work…

My idea was then and still is that if a man did his work well, the price he would get for that work—the profits and all financial matters—would care for themselves and that a business ought to start small and build itself up and out of its earnings.”
