## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet and author **Annie Dillard** on the value of a schedule:

“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days.”

​II.

Investor and businessman **Charlie Munger** on intellectual humility:

“A lot of smart people think they’re way smarter than they are, and therefore they do worse than dumb people. And it’s very common to be utterly brilliant and think you’re way the hell smarter than you are.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

The benefits that arise from a good relationship—whether it be in marriage, friendship, business, or otherwise—are often produced over a long time span.

Is it more important to win this battle or to maintain this relationship?
