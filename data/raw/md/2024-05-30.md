“Three ways to learn something new:

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

French author **Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette** offers some life advice:

“You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.”

*Source: Unconfirmed, but I believe this was originally from her novel “*[​*Cheri*​](https://amzn.to/4bHxoo2)*“*

​II.

Graphic designer **Saul Bass** on the importance of beauty:

“I want everything we do to be beautiful. I don't give a damn whether the client understands that that's worth anything, or that the client thinks it's worth anything, or whether it is worth anything. It's worth it to me. It's the way I want to live my life. I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

What are you often silently complaining about in your head and who is the person you need to actually discuss your frustrations with?

People can't react to your thoughts, only your actions. Time spent complaining to yourself is often better spent selling someone else on a new way of doing things.
