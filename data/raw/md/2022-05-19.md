​II.

“You need focus to become exceptional at anything.

Massive amounts of time and energy are wasted optimizing things that should be left undone.

You have to be great at saying no.”

“A gift you can give yourself right now:

Stop what you're doing. Close your eyes.

For the next 60 seconds, just breathe.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Interior designer **Danielle Colding** on the ultimate luxury:

“Quality of life is having the freedom to make choices that are not fear based. Whether it’s the ability to choose the kinds of projects I want to take on and can learn from, or the ability to take a month off to travel. Freedom to choose is the ultimate luxury.”

​II.

Electrical engineer **Seymour Cray**—who made a number of improvements to computer performance and is often credited with inventing the supercomputing industry—explains his approach to doing groundbreaking work:

“One of my guiding principles is don’t do anything that other people are doing. Always do something a little different if you can. The concept is that if you do it a little differently there is a greater potential for reward than if you do the same thing that other people are doing. I think that this kind of goal for one’s work, having obviously the maximum risk, would have the maximum reward no matter what the field may be.”
