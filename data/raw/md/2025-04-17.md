# 3-2-1: On good genes, personal responsibility, and how to appreciate your precious time

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Don't let the hope of finding a better way prevent you from starting down the best path you know of right now. This day won't come again.”

---

​II.

“The usual story is that people with “good genes” are those with incredible athleticism or remarkable intelligence, but sometimes I wonder if the greatest genetic edge goes to the people with whatever genes encourage the desire to compete, the ability to stay focused, and the enjoyment of practice.”

---

III.

“Focus on the things you are for, not the things you are against.

Many people spend large chunks of their day thinking about what they hate. They are always telling you about something they dislike: this food, that subject, this political party, that coworker.

You are more than your frustrations. Build your identity around what you love.”

Entrepreneur and online creator **Rob Manuel** on appreciating the opportunity you have right now:

“I'm 37. Instead of regretting that I can't wake up age 18 again, I pretend to myself that I'm 90 and I've woken up age 37 again, and that I get to magically, wonderfully have the next 50 years again.”
