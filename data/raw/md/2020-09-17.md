III.

“The 4 qualities of a great career:

1) I enjoy it  
2) I’m good at it  
3) I make good money  
4) I’m around fascinating people

Answer in reverse order:

1) Where are fascinating people?  
2) In what ways can I make money with them?  
3) Which ones am I good at?  
4) Which ones do I enjoy?”
