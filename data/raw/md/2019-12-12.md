II.

“Modern society is defined by an excess of opportunity. We have more information, more products, and more options than ever before.

As a result, curating, filtering, and refining are more important skills than ever before. Those who edit best will find the signal in the noise.”

III.

“It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop.

It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working.

It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training.

It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning.”

I.

An **Indian proverb** on living with purpose:

“Every time you wake up and ask yourself, ‘What good things am I going to do today?' remember that, when the sun goes down at sunset, it will take a part of your life with it.”

*(Note: I originally discovered this quote in Leo Tolstoy's [A Calendar of Wisdom](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qki8QVkjdhmXPDMV51jleC4AAAFuzchjOAEAAAFKAYQH0eM/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684837935/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?imprToken=OutQMOLv2mlzONEcalEmQg&slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclearema-20&creative=9325&linkCode=w61&creativeASIN=0684837935&linkId=fc20c866a2712753896a32d3b195a861))*

Poet and artist **Mary Anne Radmacher** on courage:

“Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is a quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.'”
