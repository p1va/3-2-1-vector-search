# 3-2-1: On seizing the day, perseverance, and focusing on one task at a time

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The myth is that there isn't enough time. There is plenty of time. There isn't enough focus with the time you have. You win by directing your attention toward better things.”

---

​II.

“The difference between how I feel before my first set in the gym and how I feel after my first set is enormous.

You don't even need a full workout (or work session, etc.) to feel good again. You are 5 minutes away from putting your day on a completely different trajectory.”

---

III.

“The person who focuses on one task and sees it through to completion—even if they work in a somewhat slow or outdated manner—beats the endless optimizer who jumps from tool to tool and always hopes a new piece of technology will help them finish what they start.”

Author **Jeanette Winterson** on seizing the day:

“It's hard to remember that this day will never come again. That the time is now and the place is here and that there are no second chances at a single moment.”
