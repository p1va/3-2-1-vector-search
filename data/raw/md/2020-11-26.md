“Amazing social skills are a superpower.

The ability to deliver bad news in a good way is a superpower.

The ability to de-escalate a tense situation into a calm one is a superpower.

The ability to transform a lose/win situation into a win/win situation is a superpower.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**John F. Kennedy** on gratitude:

“As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”

II.

Writer and entrepreneur **Kevin Kelly**on making life count:

“I am now 55 years old. Like a lot of people in middle age my late-night thoughts bend to contemplations about how short my remaining time is. Even with increasing longevity there is not enough time to do all that I want. Nowhere close. My friend Stewart Brand, who is now 69, has been arranging his life in blocks of 5 years. Five years is what he says any project worth doing will take. From moment of inception to the last good-riddance, a book, a campaign, a new job, a start-up will take 5 years to play through. So, he asks himself, how many 5 years do I have left? He can count them on one hand even if he is lucky. So this clarifies his choices. If he has less than 5 big things he can do, what will they be?”
