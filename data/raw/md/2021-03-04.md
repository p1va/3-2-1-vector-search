# 3-2-1: On hate as a defense mechanism, reciprocity, and consistency

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Greatness is consistency.

Meditating once is common. Meditating daily is rare.

Exercising today is simple. Training every week is simply remarkable.

Writing one essay rarely matters. Write every day and you're practically a hero.

Unheroic days can make for heroic decades.”

​II.

“An approach that has worked well for me: Friendly, but persistent.”

III.

“People generally have more control over their actions than their feelings.

But we can influence our feelings by taking action.

Take one small step. Move the body first and the mind will follow.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer**James Baldwin**on hate as a defense mechanism:

“I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.”

​II.

Basketball coach **John Wooden**, winner of 10 championships, on giving:

“There is a wonderful, almost mystical, law of nature that says three of the things we want most—happiness, freedom, and peace of mind—are always attained when we give them to others. Give it away to get it back.”
