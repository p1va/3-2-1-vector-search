​II.

“It's easier to optimize a modest start than to begin with a perfect start. Starting is the hard part, so start small and get in the mix. You'll learn a lot and you'll realize you don't need to have it all figured out to begin.”

III.

“Don't spend too much time around someone whose primary way of engaging with life is as a martyr. When suffering becomes your identity, you only see the hard parts of life.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and poet **Maya Angelou** on finding your family:

“Family isn't always blood. It's the people in your life who want you in theirs; the ones who accept you for who you are. The ones who would do anything to see you smile and who love you no matter what.”

​II.

Musician and entrepreneur **Derek Sivers** on how to handle doubts:

“If you're in doubt about something that's not in your life, try it. Things are so different in practice versus in theory. The only way to know is to experience it yourself. … Err on the side of yes. Try it. If it was a mistake, at least you’ll know first-hand, instead of always wondering.

If you're in doubt about something that's in your life already, get rid of it. Not just things, this goes for identities, habits, goals, relationships, technology, and anything else. Default to not having it, then see how you do without. … Err on the side of no. Get rid of it. Start with a clean slate. If it was a mistake, you'll get it back with a renewed enthusiasm.”
