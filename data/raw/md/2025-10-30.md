# 3-2-1: The importance of bad days, making the most money per minute, and how to start a revolution

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“What looks like a talent gap is often a focus gap. The “all-star” is often an average to above-average performer who spends more time working on what is important and less time on distractions. The talent is staying focused.”

​II.

“Something I try to remind myself:

* The strong mind finds a way to stay steady … even when plans fall apart.
* The strong body finds a way to train … even when the day doesn’t go your way.
* The strong relationship finds a way to reconnect … even when things get rough.

In a sense, what matters most is how you respond on the bad days, not the good ones.

* Anyone can smile when life goes smoothly.
* Anyone can train when they feel great.
* Anyone can be kind when the relationship is easy.

It's how you act when the situation isn't optimal that makes the difference.”

III.

“Brainstorm some answers to these questions:

* Which activity makes you the most money per minute?
* Which activity delivers the most excitement per minute?
* Which activity creates the most connection per minute?
* Which activity provides you the most laughter per minute?

And which activity is the best blend?”
