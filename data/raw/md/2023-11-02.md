# 3-2-1: How to deal with a changing world and the wonders of ordinary life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“For each headache you face, ask yourself, “Is this mostly real or mostly imagined?”

Solve the real problems, release the imaginary ones.”

​II.

“Relax. Your rumination, analysis, worry, and need to control the future are robbing you of the current moment. Yes, there is a time for preparation, but continually thinking of the future guarantees you'll never enjoy the present.”

III.

“Exerting more effort doesn't help if you're on the wrong trajectory.

– Working harder on the wrong thing just wastes more time.

– Learning more from a biased source will lead you further from the truth.

– Doubling down on a toxic relationship only sets you up for more headaches.

Before you try harder, make sure you are walking a path that leads where you want to go.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Philosopher **Eric Hoffer** on adaptability:

“In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.”

​II.

Author **William Martin**on the wonders of ordinary life:

“Do not ask your children  
to strive for extraordinary lives.  
Such striving may seem admirable,  
but it is the way of foolishness.  
Help them instead to find the wonder  
and the marvel of an ordinary life.  
Show them the joy of tasting  
tomatoes, apples and pears.  
Show them how to cry  
when pets and people die.  
Show them the infinite pleasure  
in the touch of a hand.  
And make the ordinary come alive for them.  
The extraordinary will take care of itself.”
