# 3-2-1: New paths, the danger of complexity, and making fast decisions

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Simple is nearly always better. But if it's going to be complicated, then make sure the problem is worth the complexity. A great deal of time is wasted creating complex solutions to relatively unimportant problems.”

​II.

“Many situations in life are similar to going on a hike: the view changes once you start walking.

You don't need all the answers right now. New paths will reveal themselves if you have the courage to get started.”

A simple reminder from [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits):

“Time will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Singer and songwriter, **Aretha Franklin,** on seeing people as more than just their worst moment:

“You cannot define a person on just one thing. You can’t just forget all these wonderful and good things that a person has done because one thing didn’t come off the way you thought it should come off.”

​II.

Computer programmer **Ward Cunningham** on the importance of making fast, reversible decisions:

“I can't tell you how much time is spent worrying about decisions that don't matter. To just be able to make a decision and see what happens is tremendously empowering, but that means you have to set up the situation such that when something does go wrong, you can fix it.”
