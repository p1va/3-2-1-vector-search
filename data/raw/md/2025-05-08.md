# 3-2-1: On waiting to judge, the value of teaching, and learning how to lose

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The secret to winning is learning how to lose. That is, learning to bounce back from failure and disappointment—undeterred—and continuing to steadily march toward your potential. Your response to failure determines your capacity for success.”

---

​II.

“The Paradox of Freedom: The way to expand your freedom is to narrow your focus.

* Stay focused on saving to achieve financial freedom.
* Stay focused on training to achieve physical freedom.
* Stay focused on learning to achieve intellectual freedom.

The disciplined become the free.”

---

III.

“The person who learns the most in any classroom is the teacher.

If you really want to learn a topic, then “teach” it. Write a book. Teach a class. Build a product. Start a company.

The act of making something will force you to learn more deeply than reading ever will.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Philosopher and spiritual teacher **Jiddu Krishnamurti** on pausing before we judge everything:

“The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.”

​II.

Writer and scholar **C.S. Lewis** reminds us that what looks best is when we stop worrying about looking good and start focusing on doing our best:

“The sword glitters not because the swordsman set out to make it glitter but because he is fighting for his life and therefore moving it very quickly.”
