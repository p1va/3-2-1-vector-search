# 3-2-1: The antidote to a bad day, teaching, and the healing power of story

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“There is a difference between moving fast and rushing.

You can move fast and be thoughtful. When you rush, you sacrifice thoughtfulness.

Conversely, when you are thoughtful but not moving fast, you are overthinking it. Procrastination in disguise.

Don’t rush, but don’t wait.”

“The more you create, the more powerful you become.

The more you consume, the more powerful others become.”
