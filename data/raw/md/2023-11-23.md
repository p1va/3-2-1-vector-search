## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Consistency enlarges ability.”

​II.

“You probably don't want maximum effectiveness.

For example, the most effective way to make money likely requires a lifestyle you don't want to live. Instead, you want the most effective path that fits your desired lifestyle.

How do you want to spend your days? Start there, then optimize.”

III.

“One of the most unexpected gifts you can receive is an early loss.

* Missing out on a job you really wanted.
* Trying a business idea that fails.
* Suffering a heartbreak.

An early setback can become the catalyst for a wonderful next chapter—if you channel the emotion effectively.

Disappointment is a hot burning fuel. Let it light your fire to become better.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Steven Pressfield** on the boundary between work and self:

“The professional loves her work. She is invested in it wholeheartedly. But she does not forget that the work is not her.”

​II.

Musician **Nick Cave** on the power of small actions:

“The everyday human gesture is always a heartbeat away from the miraculous.

Remember that ultimately we make things happen through our actions, way beyond our understanding or intention; that our seemingly small ordinary human acts have untold consequences; that what we do in this world means something; that we are not nothing; and that our most quotidian human actions by their nature burst the seams of our intent and spill meaningfully and radically through time and space, changing everything.

Our deeds, no matter how insignificant they may feel, are replete with meaning, and of vast consequence, and that they constantly impact upon the unfolding story of the world, whether we know it or not.”
