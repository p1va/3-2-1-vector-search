# 3-2-1: On weaknesses, the secret to happiness, and what you want but haven’t said

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“You can ignore your weaknesses, but you can't expect them to not impact you. The weakness of the coach shapes the players. The weakness of the teacher influences the students. The weakness of the parent molds the child.”

​II.

“Don't wait to start writing until you have something to say. Start writing so you can find out what you have to say.

You first idea is rarely your best idea. It can take a lot of reps before you discover something worth keeping.”

III.

“You will never find one answer to what makes you happy. There are many answers, and they change based on your current state.

People need to relax, but if all you do is sit on the beach, it gets old. People find meaning in work, but if all you do is work, it gets exhausting. People benefit from exercise, but if all you do is exercise, it gets unhealthy.

Happiness will always be fleeting because your needs change over time. The question is: what do you need right now?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Painter **Vincent Van Gogh** on pushing yourself:

“I am always doing what I can't do yet in order to learn how to do it.”

​II.

Writer and translator **Estelle Gilson** shares this translation of a rejection slip issued by a Chinese economic journal and, in the process, reveals the most incredible way to say no:

“We have read your manuscript with boundless delight. If we were to publish your paper, it would be impossible for us to publish any work of lower standard. And as it is unthinkable that in the next thousand years we shall see its equal, we are, to our regret, compelled to return your divine composition and to beg you a thousand times to overlook our short sight and timidity.”
