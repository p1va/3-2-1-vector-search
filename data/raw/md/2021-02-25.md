## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.

You don’t have to do it all today. Just lay a brick.”

“School requires you to learn about things after the answer has already been decided.

Life requires you to learn about things while the answer is in the process of being decided.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Film director and screenwriter **Krzysztof Kieslowski** on unity:

“If there is anything worthwhile doing for the sake of culture, then it is touching on subject matters and situations which link people, and not those that divide people. There are too many things in the world which divide people, such as religion, politics, history, and nationalism.

If culture is capable of anything, then it is finding that which unites us all. And there are so many things which unite people. It doesn't matter who you are or who I am—if your tooth aches or mine, it's still the same pain. Feelings are what link people together, because the word “love” has the same meaning for everybody. Or “fear,” or “suffering.” We all fear the same way … and we all love in the same way.

That's why I tell about these things, because in all other things I immediately find division.”

​II.

Poet **Diane Ackerman** on reinventing yourself:

“Living things tend to change unrecognizably as they grow. Who would deduce the dragonfly from the larva, the iris from the bud, the lawyer from the infant?

Flora or fauna, we are all shapeshifters and magical reinventors. Life is really a plural noun, a caravan of selves.”
