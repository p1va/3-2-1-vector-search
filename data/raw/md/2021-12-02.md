# 3-2-1: Resilience, growth, and a guiding question for new opportunities

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“When considering a new project or opportunity, one of the first questions to ask is, “How do I want to spend my days?”

Make as few choices as possible that violate your answer.

Many opportunities seem exciting but actually give you less of the life you want.”

III.

“Be kind. You should do it simply to be decent, but do it even if you’re a ruthless mercenary because you have no idea where people will end up in 10 years. The balance of power is always shifting. People will surprise you.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The Greek poet, **Dinos Christianopoulos,** shares a message on resilience:

“They tried to bury us. They didn’t know we were seeds.”

*This saying has become a rallying cry for many political and social movements. In particular, it was utilized by Mexican activists and is often attributed as a Mexican proverb. The literal translation from Greek reads: “What didn’t you do to bury me / but you forgot I was a seed.”*

​II.

Journalist and author, **Gail Sheehy,** on growth:

“If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we are not really living.

Growth demands a temporary surrender of security. It may mean a giving up of familiar but limiting patterns, safe but unrewarding work, values no longer believed in, relationships that have lost their meaning.

As Dostoevsky put it, “Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.” The real fear should be of the opposite course.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

A question from Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft:

“What should exist? To me, that's the most exciting question imaginable. What do we need that we don't have?”
