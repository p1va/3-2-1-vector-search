## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The best way to get the attention and respect of exceptional people is to do exceptional work.

Like attracts like.”

II.

“The paradox of risk:

(1) Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you lose the basket, you lose it all.

(2) Don't put your eggs in too many baskets. The more baskets you manage, the less energy you can put into each one. It's risky to do things halfway.

Diversified, but focused.”

I.

In honor of Earth Day, which happened earlier this week, a **Native American proverb** to consider:

“Treat the Earth well. It was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children.”

II.

Comedian **Jerry Seinfeld** on what it takes to make something great:

INTERVIEWER: You and Larry David wrote Seinfeld together, without a traditional writers’ room, and burnout was one reason you stopped. Was there a more sustainable way to do it? Could McKinsey or someone have helped you find a better model?

SEINFELD: Who’s McKinsey?

INTERVIEWER: It’s a consulting firm.

SEINFELD: Are they funny?

INTERVIEWER: No.

SEINFELD: Then I don’t need them. If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting. That’s my way of life.
