# 3-2-1: How our quests shape us and being kind to the future

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

Something a friend told me recently:

“Never do anything in the gym today that prevents you from working out tomorrow.”

---

​II.

Something my four-year-old told me recently:

“We need to be kind to the future.”

You can apply that to your own life and the world at large.

---

III.

Something I'm trying to practice:

“Don't just tell your spouse that you *love* them–tell them why you *like* them. Point out the qualities that make them fun to be around, the parts of their personality that shine, the little moments you genuinely enjoy together. ‘I love you' matters, but so does ‘I like spending time with you.'”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer **John Steinbeck** on giving ourselves permission to act, learn, and grow:

“And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.”

​II.

French writer and poet **Rene Daumal** reminds us that it's not about what we achieve, but who we become in the process:

“You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down again. So why bother in the first place? Just this: What is above knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is above. One climbs, one sees. One descends, one sees no longer, but one has seen. There is an art of conducting oneself in the lower regions by the memory of what one saw higher up. When one can no longer see, one can at least still know.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Many of the good things in life are downstream from being helpful and useful to others. What can you do today to be useful to someone else?
