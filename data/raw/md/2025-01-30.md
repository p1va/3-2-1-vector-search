# 3-2-1: On the danger of a good idea, how to do your best work, and a question to inspire action

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Beware the student of one teacher. A good idea spirals into dogma when it gets applied to everything and stretched beyond the areas where it is useful. Remain open and embrace a lot of teachers.”

​II.

“Your best performances will come when you are working in a way that is a full expression of you. The work becomes a natural display of your personality. This is when you not only get better results, but also love the activity — because in doing the craft, you feel alive.”

III.

“People can sometimes be held hostage by their expectations. They have a dream of something they would like to achieve or a path they intend to follow, but their mindset falls apart when things don't work out how they had hoped.

The key is to reach for an extremely high bar, but to be adaptable enough to reframe the failures, disappointments, and defeats into fuel for the next thing. Give your best effort, but no matter how it works out, trust that life will be good for you. Focus on how the world is working with you, not against you.

Everything you are given is material for the next move. Everything.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Physician and educator **Maria Montessori** on leading others:

“The greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say, “The children are now working as if I did not exist.” But this holds true for leadership in general—give people space and they flourish.”

​II.

Physicist and chemist **Marie Curie** on the connection between fear and knowledge:

“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”
