# 3-2-1: Lucky breaks, how people learn, and a theory of life

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you're always right, you're not learning.

If you're never failing, you're not reaching.

The objective is to be right. The objective is to succeed.

But if you're always winning, you're undershooting your potential.”

​II.

“Many people are not ready for their lucky break when it comes to them.

Develop your skills. Study your craft. Save some money. Build a network before you need it. Lay the ground work.

The prepared person is positioned to benefit from unexpected opportunities.”

III.

“Commitment makes good things better and bad things worse.

The more “all-in” you are on a good relationship, the better it becomes. The more you commit to a toxic relationship, the deeper you get trapped.

The more you invest yourself in fulfilling work, the more your effort fuels you. The harder you work on a bad project or in an unsatisfying role, the more of a grind it becomes.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Schoolteacher and suffragist, **Alice Moore Hubbard,** on how people learn:

“Teaching is successful only as it causes people to think for themselves. What the teacher thinks matters little; what he makes the child think matters much.”

​II.

Science fiction writer, **Teresa Nielsen Hayden,** offers a theory of life:

“My own personal theory is that this is the very dawn of the world. We're hardly more than an eyeblink away from the fall of Troy, and scarcely an interglaciation removed from the Altamira cave painters. We live in extremely interesting ancient times.

I like this idea. It encourages us to be earnest and ingenious and brave, as befits ancestral peoples; but keeps us from deciding that because we don't know all the answers, they must be unknowable and thus unprofitable to pursue.”
