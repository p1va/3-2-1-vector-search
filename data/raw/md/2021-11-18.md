# 3-2-1: On lucky events, saying thank you, and the value of ignoring some problems

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Most lucky events in life are opportunities, not outcomes.

The value of an opportunity changes depending on how it is treated. Without effort, good luck becomes a missed opportunity. With effort, good luck can become a life-changing event.

You need luck and hard work. It's not either/or. It's both/and. The result will not walk through the door on its own.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬”

​II.

“When in doubt, just say thank you. There is no downside. Are you honestly worried about showing too much gratitude to the people in your life?”

III.

“How much could I lose?” is not merely a financial question.

If I make this choice:

– How much time could I lose?

– How much sanity could I lose?

– How much reputation could I lose?

– How much happiness could I lose?

Opportunity cost is about a lot more than money.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Author **Leo Tolstoy** on the importance of being kind—particularly when communicating with others:

“You should know that when a message you convey to another person is not understood by him, at least one of the following things is true: what you have said is not true, or you have conveyed it without kindness.”
