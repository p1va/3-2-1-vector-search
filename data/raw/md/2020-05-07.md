## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The painter, **Paula Modersohn-Becker**, on making life a celebration:

“I know that I shall not live very long. But I wonder, is that sad? Is a celebration more beautiful because it lasts longer? And my life is a celebration, a short, intense celebration.”

*Source: Excerpt of her journal (1897); as quoted in [Voicing our Visions: Writings by Women Artists](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0704343029/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclearema-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0704343029&linkId=bcbfe9f90288b50b4480c6c9a0061e4a)*

II.

The physician and writer, **Oliver Sacks,**explains the value of gardens:

“As a writer, I find gardens essential to the creative process; as a physician, I take my patients to gardens whenever possible. All of us have had the experience of wandering through a lush garden or a timeless desert, walking by a river or an ocean, or climbing a mountain and finding ourselves simultaneously calmed and reinvigorated, engaged in mind, refreshed in body and spirit. The importance of these physiological states on individual and community health is fundamental and wide-ranging. In forty years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical “therapy” to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.”
