# 3-2-1: On media consumption, needless commitments, and persistence and luck

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Your actions are a consequence of your thoughts.

Your thoughts are a consequence of what you consume.

And in the modern age, what you consume is largely a consequence of how you select and refine your social media feed.

Choose better inputs. Get better outputs.”

III.

“Needless commitments are more wasteful than needless possessions. Possessions can be ignored, but commitments are a recurring debt that must be paid for with your time and attention.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

This quote from **Henry David Thoreau**, the American poet and author, pairs nicely with my third idea above:

“The cost of a thing is the amount of … life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.”

II.

The American entrepreneur and investor **Sam Altman** on persistence and luck:

“A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

“Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.”
