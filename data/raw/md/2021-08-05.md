# 3-2-1: A quick tip for building habits that last, and the connection between art and an open mind

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“A quick and easy tip for building habits that last:

Pick a standard time and place to do it.

It’s easier to wake up knowing “I exercise at 4pm” than to decide each time when to fit a habit into your day.

If it’s already decided, all you need to do is show up.”

“Spend more time searching for better information sources.

A body filled with junk food struggles to move well.

A mind filled with junk thoughts struggles to think well.”

III.

“Different meanings can be assigned to the same events.

Look for evidence of how the world is encouraging you, and you will find it.

Look for evidence of how the world is burdening you, and you will find it.

Choose an explanation that empowers you.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Theoretical physicist **Richard Feynman** with some advice for life:

“Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”

​II.

Writer **Jeanette Winterson** on the connection between art and an open mind:

“Most of us spend a lot of time censoring everything that we see and hear. Does it fit with our world picture? And if it doesn't, how can we shut it out, how can we ignore it, how can we challenge it? We are continually threatened in life, it's true. But once you are alone with a book, and it's also true with a picture or with music, all those defenses drop and you can enter into a quite different space where you will learn to think differently about yourself.”
