“Odds are, the latest office debate or family squabble isn't worth winning. Most arguments are only tangentially related to your end goal.

What outcomes are you actually trying to create? What type of life are you actually trying to cultivate? Stay focused.”

“The first step—perhaps the most enormous step—is to find what you are genuinely interested in.

If you are genuinely interested, you will discover endless opportunities for improvement. But if you are disinterested, even obvious improvements will feel like a chore.

And, if you can maintain your genuine interest and curiosity as the years accumulate, you will become hard to compete with because you will have skill to go with your passion. If you're interested, you're dangerous.”

Poet and activist **June Jordan**on the pain of truth:
