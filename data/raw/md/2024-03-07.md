# 3-2-1: On creating the conditions for joy, how to go to hell, and the simple way to clarify your thinking

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“You can go to hell without moving an inch, just focus on what you lack.

You can taste heaven without leaving earth, just rejoice in what you have.”

“The simplest way to clarify your thinking is to write a full page about whatever you are dealing with and then delete everything except the 1-2 sentences that explain it best.”

III.

“The reason people get good ideas in the shower is because it's the only time during the day when most people are away from screens long enough to think clearly. The lesson is not to take more showers, but rather to make more time to think.”
