III.

“How to clarify a concept you can't articulate:

1. Change mediums. Draw it. Photograph it. Sing it.

2. Change levels. Explain what is one level up (bigger picture) or one level down (finer details).

3. Change fields. What would this concept look like in different fields?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHER

I.

Novelist and writer **Francine Prose** on hard conversations:

“Sometimes being in a car, looking at the road, not having to make eye contact, is the ideal setting for heavy conversation.”

​II.

Author and entrepreneur **Eliot Peper** on taking risks:

“If you know something's going to work, it's not worth working on. It requires no courage. It requires no faith. It requires no skin in the game. Whether you're a spy or a teacher or a spouse or a painter or an abuela or an astronaut or a monk or a barista or a board-game designer, the bits that matter are the bits you make matter by putting yourself on the line for them. The unknown is the foundry where you forge your chips. Everything important is uncertain. Sitting with the discomfort of that uncertainty is the hard part, the wedge that can move the world.”
