III.

“The ability to love yourself improves your ability to be loved.

We are unlikely to accept a relationship that is worse than the one we have with ourselves, and thus the person who is happy and comfortable with themselves is in a great position.

The person with healthy self-esteem doesn't have to jump into any relationship because they already have a great one wherever they go.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Philosopher and professor **Marshall McLuhan** on adapting and evolving:

“Resenting a new technology will not halt its progress.”

​II.

Writer **Sarah Perry** on how to build an exercise habit you actually enjoy (or any habit, really):

“Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely.

Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure.”
