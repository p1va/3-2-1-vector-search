III.

“When an online course tells you how to make money in real estate remember they are making money by selling online courses.

When a conference covers how to build an online business remember they are building an event business.

Learn from what people do as much as what they say.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Therapist **Esther Perel** on the importance of relationships:

“Life will present you with unexpected opportunities, and you won't always know in advance which are the important moments. Above all, it's the quality of your relationships that will determine the quality of your life. Invest in your connections, even those that seem inconsequential.”
