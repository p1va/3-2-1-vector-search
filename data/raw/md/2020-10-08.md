## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Do the most important thing first each day and you'll never have an unproductive day.”

II.

“Lack of confidence kills more dreams than lack of ability.

Talent matters—especially at elite levels—but people talk themselves out of giving their best effort long before talent becomes the limiting factor.

You're capable of more than you know. Don't be your own bottleneck.”

III.

“Entrepreneur’s mind.  
Athlete’s body.  
Artist’s soul.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Professional volleyball player **Gabby Reece** on the power of going first:

“I always say that I'll go first…

That means if I'm checking out at the store, I'll say hello first.

If I'm coming across somebody and make eye contact, I'll smile first.

[I wish] people would experiment with that in their life a little bit. Be first, because – not all times, but most times – it comes in your favor.”

II.

Writer **Hugh Walpole**on being a generalist and a specialist:

“The whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and a thousand other things well.”
