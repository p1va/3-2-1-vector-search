# 3-2-1: On success and failure, kindness and mortality, and taking action

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Success is never due to one thing, but failure can be.

Sleeping well won’t make you successful, but not sleeping enough will hold you back. Hard work is rarely enough without good strategy, but even the best strategy is useless without hard work.

Many things are necessary, but not sufficient for success.”

II.

“Life is too short to not be pursuing the best opportunity you know of.”

III.

“Today might be the best chance you have to take action.

The longer you wait, the more deeply embedded you get in your current lifestyle.

Your habits solidify. Your beliefs harden. You get comfortable.

It will never be easy, but it may also never be easier than it is right now.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

**E.O. Wilson,**a sociobiologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, on the promise and peril of the future:

“The real problem of humanity is the following: we have paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions; and god-like technology.

II.

An **Indian proverb**on kindness and mortality:

“Never postpone a good deed which you can do now, because death does not choose whether you have or haven’t done the things you should have done. Death waits for nobody and nothing. It has neither enemies, nor friends.”
