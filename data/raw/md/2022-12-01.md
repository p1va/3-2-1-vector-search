# 3-2-1: The last 30 days of the year, the power of thoughts, and certainty

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Some things are a job, others are a craft. The primary difference is not the task, but the enthusiasm and curiosity put into the task. The more engaged and interested you are, the more it becomes a craft.”

​II.

“It only takes five minutes to break the cycle.

Five minutes of exercise and you are back on the path. Five minutes of writing and the manuscript is moving forward again. Five minutes of conversation and the relationship is restored.

It doesn't take much to feel good again.”

III.

“Nobody accomplishes anything significant alone.

But nobody accomplishes anything significant by accident either. Just because you need others doesn't mean you can wait for others to make it happen.

You have to act as if you are a force of nature and try to bend the universe in your desired direction—while remaining pleasant and open to help along the way.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Journalist **Hal Boyle** on certainty: “What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn’t have any doubt—it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn’t want to go anywhere else.”

​II.

Writer and suffragist **Lucy Mallory** on the power of thoughts:

“Every thought a person dwells upon, whether he expresses it or not, either damages or improves his life.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

There is one month left in the year. Most people are ready to coast to the finish line, but one good month can make the whole year feel like a success.

What can you do in the next 30 days to build momentum and finish the year on a high note?
