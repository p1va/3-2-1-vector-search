# 3-2-1: On change, margin of safety, and handling criticism

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The idea that ‘change is hard' is one of the biggest myths about human behavior.

The truth is, you change effortlessly and all the time. The primary job of the brain is to adjust your behavior based on the environment.

Design a better environment. Change will happen naturally.”

II.

“A simple way to ensure you are focused on what matters:

Imagine everything gets wiped. You inherit no tasks or responsibilities from your past or present. Then, add back only what you miss.

Choose what to add to a blank slate, not what to keep from a full plate.”

III.

“Having good health isn’t everything, but not having it is.

Having money isn’t everything, but not having it is.

You don’t need 6-pack abs or a million dollars to be happy, but it is worth learning the fundamentals of fitness and finance.

They bring a margin of safety.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Today I have two quotes on taking risks and handling criticism that pair well together:

I.

The first comes from French-Swiss film director **Jean-Luc Godard:**

“He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch.”

II.

The second is from **Theodore Roosevelt:**

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Are things truly not going well … or do I just need some food, water, and a short break?​
