# 3-2-1: On copying best practices, being underestimated, and the difficulty of change

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you never copy best practices, you’ll have to repeat all the mistakes yourself.

If you only copy best practices, you’ll always be one step behind the leaders.”

​II.

“A brief guide to improvement:

1) Lots of research. Explore widely and see what is possible.

2) Lots of iterations. Focus on one thing, but do it in different ways. Refine your method.

3) Lots of repetitions. Stick with your method until it stops working.

Research. Iterate. Repeat.”

III.

“Being underestimated is a gift. You don’t have to find motivation.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author **Mary H.K. Choi** on the importance of not waiting:

“It doesn’t get any less scary. All that happens is that you have less life left. It helps if you do your falling early, and it really helps if you do your reaching early.”

​II.

**James Baldwin** on the difficulty of change:

“Nothing is more desirable than to be released from an affliction, but nothing is more frightening than to be divested of a crutch.”
