III.

“The way to attract good luck is to be reliable in a valuable area.

The more you repeatedly deliver value, the more people seek you out for that value.

Your reputation is a magnet. Once you become known for something, relevant opportunities come to you with no extra work.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

The American author and poet, **Anne Lamott**, on the benefits of rest:

“Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.”

II.

**Daniel Chambliss**, an American sociologist, on how top performers feel about hard work:

“At the higher levels of competitive swimming, something like an inversion of attitude takes place. The very features of the sport that the ‘C' swimmer finds unpleasant, the top level swimmer enjoys. What others see as boring—swimming back and forth over a black line for two hours, say—they find peaceful, even meditative, often challenging, or therapeutic. They enjoy hard practices, look forward to difficult competitions, try to set difficult goals. Coming into the 5:30 A.M. practices at Mission Viejo, many of the swimmers were lively, laughing, talking, enjoying themselves, perhaps appreciating the fact that most people would positively hate doing it. It is incorrect to believe that top athletes suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often, they don’t see what they do as sacrificial at all. They like it.”
