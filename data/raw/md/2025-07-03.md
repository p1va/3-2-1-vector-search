# 3-2-1: On becoming hard to copy, the power of fundamentals, and three qualities that matter

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The fundamentals: Something many people know, but few people practice.”

---

​II.

“When I notice myself worrying about ‘what other people will think,' I find I'm usually not worried about any single person's opinion.

If I pick a specific person, I'm rarely concerned about what they will think. What I fear is the collective opinion in my head. It's imaginary.”

III.

“Three qualities that have nothing to do with talent or intelligence, but can make a dramatic impact on your results:

* Cheerful. You are pleasant to work with and generally raise the level of energy in the room.
* Accountable. You feel personally responsible for what you want to accomplish. It is not someone else's job. It's your job.
* Adaptable. You can find alternate paths to success. You don't need things to be a certain way to be happy.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Author and journalist **Edward St. Aubyn** on friendship:

“They had drifted apart, as people do when they promise to stay in touch; the ones who are going to stay in touch don't need to promise.”

​II.

Engineer **Harrington Emerson** on knowing your principles:

“As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The person who grasps principles can successfully select their own methods. The person who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.”

*Source: The Clothier and Furnisher (July 1911)*
