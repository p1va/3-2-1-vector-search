II.

An idea from [Atomic Habits](https://atomichabits.com/):

“The key—if you want to build habits that last—is to join a group where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.”

III.

“In the long-run, the people who succeed are the ones who want to live the lifestyle that precedes the results.

Stop asking, “What results do I want to have?”

Start asking, “What lifestyle do I want to live?”

It's common to want results. It's rare to want the lifestyle.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Investor **Bill Ackma****n** on the link between success and failure:

“I’ve always had the view that how successful you are is really a function of how you deal with failure. If you deal with failure well and you persist, you have a high probability of being successful.”

Author **Toni Morrison** shares a lesson from her father:

“…one day, alone in the kitchen with my father, I let drop a few whines about the job. I gave him details, examples of what troubled me, yet although he listened intently, I saw no sympathy in his eyes. No “Oh, you poor little thing.”

Perhaps he understood that what I wanted was a solution to the job, not an escape from it. In any case, he put down his cup of coffee and said, “Listen. You don’t live there. You live here. With your people. Go to work. Get your money. And come on home.”

That was what he said. This was what I heard:

1. Whatever the work is, do it well—not for the boss but for yourself.

2. You make the job; it doesn’t make you.

3. Your real life is with us, your family.

4. You are not the work you do; you are the person you are.

I have worked for all sorts of people since then, geniuses and morons, quick-witted and dull, bighearted and narrow. I’ve had many kinds of jobs, but since that conversation with my father I have never considered the level of labor to be the measure of myself, and I have never placed the security of a job above the value of home.”
