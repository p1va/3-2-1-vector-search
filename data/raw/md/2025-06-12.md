# 3-2-1: On time machines, principles for high performance, and the trap of titles

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Books are the nearest thing to a time machine humans have ever made.”

---

​II.

“Don't let a title become a trap.

* “I have to be a doctor.”
* “I need to get into that school.”
* “I can't quit this job—it's Google.”

There are many ways to live an amazing life. Stop thinking about the status of this particular title and focus on the substance of what you want. You’ll often find there are many ways to get similar amounts of joy, purpose, or freedom.

If you attach your happiness to a single path, you'll become blind to other wonderful opportunities around you. And many of them might be a better fit for you or deliver a similar result with less struggle.”

III.

“Win the day and go on your way.

There are always doubts:

* But what if…
* Will I be able to…
* Should I be worried about…

Leave it be. Have the best day you can today. Win the moment in front of you right now.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

​II.

Author and journalist **Min Jin Lee** on what is important:

“I heard in a sermon once that the definition of self-control was to choose the important over the urgent.

Often, I've wished that I could've had quicker success, greater financial security, more respect, et cetera, as a writer. For nearly twelve years now since leaving the law, I have often felt ashamed for wanting to be a writer and doubtful of my talents.

What helped in these moments was to consider what was important, rather than the urgent feelings of embarrassment and helplessness. What was important is still important now: to learn to write better in order to better complete the vision one holds in one's head and to enjoy the writing, because the work has to be the best part.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Each person carries an invisible backpack full of unfinished tasks. These things can weigh on you, especially the ones that you feel like you should do but know you probably won't make time for.

There are two ways to lighten the load: finish the task or let it go. Give yourself permission to stop worrying about the things you're never going to do.

What's weighing down your backpack that needs to be released?
