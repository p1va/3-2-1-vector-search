II.

“You always hold the rights to your effort, but never to your results.

Results are entitled to no one. At best, they are on loan and must be renewed each day.

All you own is the right to try.”

III.

“Some of the major drivers of human behavior…

* Safety: Does it provide peace of mind or reduce risk?
* Sex: Does it help them find love or make love?
* Convenience: Does it save time or energy?
* Social norms: Does it help them get along with others?
* Status: Does it improve their standing or help them gain approval?

…which all fit into the larger category of self-interest: How does it serve the person?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist **Jennifer Egan** on reading as fuel:

“Reading is the nourishment that lets you do interesting work.“

II.

Inventor and businessman **Thomas Edison**on focus:

“You do something all day long, don’t you? Every one does. If you get up at seven o’clock and go to bed at eleven, you have put in sixteen good hours, and it is certain with most people, that they have been doing something all the time. They have been either walking, or reading, or writing, or thinking. The only trouble is that they do it about a great many things and I do it about one. If they took the time in question and applied it in one direction, to one object, they would succeed. Success is sure to follow such application. The trouble lies in the fact that people do not have an object, one thing, to which they stick, letting all else go. Success is the product of the severest kind of mental and physical application.”
