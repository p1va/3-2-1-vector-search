# 3-2-1: Eliminating tasks, optimizing for your interests, and sharing knowledge

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“What are my top risks? How can I mitigate them?

What are my unique strengths? How can I leverage them?

The objective is to survive long enough to see the rewards of your advantage accumulate.”

​II.

“Sure, at some level, every experience in life boils down to your interpretation of it. And if you can shift your mindset, then perhaps you can turn a negative experience into a positive one.

But life is not a hallucination. You still have to deal with things. A healthy perspective can lessen the burden, but so can taking action. A problem that is solved is one that you don't need to mentally reframe.”

III.

“Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task.

Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned.

Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized.

Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished.

Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Award-winning painter, **Georgia O'Keefe,** suggests optimizing for your interests rather than your happiness:

“I do not like the idea of happiness — it is too momentary. I would say that I was always busy and interested in something — interest has more meaning to me than the idea of happiness.”

**Marie-Christine Gasingirwa,** a director at the Ministry of Education in Rwanda, reminds us that knowledge is a shared experience:

“In life there isn’t a single person that knows everything and there is no person that knows nothing. It’s not too late to learn because you just need to develop that interest, talk to people, share with them what you have and learn from them. There is no breakthrough in this world if you are isolated, you can only make a breakthrough by talking to people.
