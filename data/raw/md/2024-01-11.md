I.

“The pessimist criticizes, the optimist creates.”

​II.

“Save more money than you think you need. Life is unexpected and your future tastes will likely be more expensive. Not worrying about money tomorrow is worth more than whatever you could buy today.”

III.

“I have learned that whenever I think “I don't have enough time to do that” what I usually mean is “I don't have enough energy” or “I am not actually interested in doing this.”

What I need to do a better job of is not managing my time, but rather caring for myself and identifying my true interests. When I am well rested and working on something I am genuinely excited about, finding time is rarely a problem.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Writer and activist **James Baldwin** on what love looks like:

“The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other's light.”

​II.

Investor **Warren Buffett** on holding your temper:

“My good friend and hero, Tom Murphy, had an incredible generosity of spirit. He would do five things for you without thinking about whether you did something for him. After he was done with those five things, he'd be thinking about how to do the sixth. He was also an enormously able person in business and was kind of effortless about it. He didn't have to shout or scream or anything like that. He did everything in a very relaxed manner.

Forty years ago, Tom gave me one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received. He said, “Warren, you can always tell someone to go to hell tomorrow.” It's such an easy way of putting it. You haven't missed the opportunity. Just forget about it for a day. If you feel the same way tomorrow, tell them then—but don't spout off in a moment of anger.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

Winston Churchill once said, “It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required.”

Think about what you are working toward this year. Are you doing what is required or are you looking for a shortcut?
