# 3-2-1: On the power of simple ideas, focus, and asking good questions

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

*“Take a simple idea and take it seriously.”  
—Charlie Munger*

Doing a few sets of pushups each day is a simple idea.

Saving at least 10% of your income is a simple idea.

Sending Thank You notes is a simple idea.

…but most people don't take simple ideas seriously.

“What looks like a talent gap is often a focus gap.

The ‘all star' is often an average to above average performer who spends more time working on what is important and less time on distractions.

The talent is staying focused.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Theologian and social justice leader **Howard Thurman** on passion:

“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”

II.

The physicist **Isidor Isaac Rabi** on the importance of good questions (and good mothers):

“My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to.

Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school: ‘So? Did you learn anything today?'

But not my mother.

‘Izzy,' she would say, ‘did you ask a good question today?'

That difference — asking good questions — made me become a scientist.”
