## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Before you throw more time at the problem, throw more focused action at the problem. You don’t need more time, you need fewer distractions.”

​II.

“Patience only works if you do.

Doing the work + patience = results.

Planning to work + patience = you're just waiting.”

III.

“Momentum goes both ways.

Don’t move, feel sluggish. Start moving, feel like moving a little more.

Don't talk, feel timid. Start chatting, conversation gets a little easier.

Don't ship, feel stuck. Start creating, ideas begin to flow.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Mountaineer **Alex Lowe** on how to be the best:

“The best climber in the world is the one who's having the most fun.”

​II.

Poet **Wislawa Szymborska** on the source of inspiration:

“Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous *I don't know.*“

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

How would my daily schedule change if I did a little more of what I'm great at and a little less of what I'm not great at?
