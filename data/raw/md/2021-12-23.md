# 3-2-1: Ending the year on a high note, maximizing your strength, and taking responsibility

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“If you're not working hard, ideas don’t matter. The best idea is worthless without execution.

If you're already working hard, ideas are crucial. Most effort is wasted on mediocre ideas.”

​II.

“Don't over-improve your weaknesses. If you're not good at something, work on it until it no longer prevents your progress, but the bulk of your time is better spent maximizing your strengths.”

III.

“Life rarely changes in a positive way without an increase in responsibility.

That can mean taking ownership of your health or committing to a relationship or starting a business.

Whatever it is, if you want the trajectory to change, the amount of responsibility usually has to change.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

Author **Jeanette Winterson** on risk:

“What you risk reveals what you value.”

​II.

Poet and novelist **Margaret Atwood** on being like water:

“Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can't go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.”
