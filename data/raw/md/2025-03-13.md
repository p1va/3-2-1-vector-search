# 3-2-1: On the secret to youth, how to achieve what you want, and the challenge of being yourself

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The person who experiences the consequences should make the decision.”

---

​II.

“You are as old as the risks you take. In many ways, aging is not the process of growing old, but rather the slow death of becoming overly protective, scared, and worried about losing what you have. Youth is found in the energy of going for it, taking the risk, and trusting that you'll figure it out along the way.”

III.

“The Process:

1. Decide what you want to achieve.
2. Try different ways of achieving it until you find one that works for you.
3. Do more of what works. Do less of what doesn’t.
4. Don’t stop doing it until it stops working.
5. Repeat.

It is both this simple and this hard.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS
