# 3-2-1: On allowing yourself to be happy and full, and how small errors compound

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Repetition unlocks value.

The value of your first workout increases the more you exercise.

The value of your first article increases the more you write.

The value of your first conversation increases the longer you stay in the relationship.

Day One continues to compound.”

​II.

“The sooner you make a choice, the sooner you can make an adjustment.”

III.

“Books are more likely to change minds than conversations.

There is too much happening internally during conversation:

Did that sound stupid?  
What do they think of me?  
Will I lose the friendship over this opinion?

Books can let you chew on an idea without social risk.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Poet **Mary Oliver** on allowing yourself to be happy and full:

“If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don’t hesitate. Give in to it.

…whatever it is, don’t be afraid of its plenty.

Joy is not made to be a crumb.”

​II.

Philosopher and priest **Franz Brentano** on how small errors compound:

“What is at first small is often extremely large in the end. And so it happens that whoever deviates only a little from truth in the beginning is led farther and farther afield in the sequel, and to errors which are a thousand times as large.”
