# 3-2-1: On mental toughness, self-awareness, and providing value

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“The fastest way to raise your level of performance:

Cut your number of commitments in half.”

II.

“Before you ask for readers, write the article you wish you could read. Before you ask for the sale, create the product you wish you had.

Before you need support, be the supportive friend. Before you need love, be the loving partner.

Always give value before you ask for value.”

III.

“You are only as mentally tough as your life demands you to be.

An easy life fashions a mind that can only handle ease. A challenging life builds a mind that can handle challenge. Like a muscle that atrophies without use, mental strength fades unless it is tested.

When life doesn't challenge you, challenge yourself.​”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Japanese writer **Haruki Murakami** on kindness and disagreement:

“Always remember that to argue, and win, is to break down the reality of the person you are arguing against. It is painful to lose your reality, so be kind, even if you are right.”

II.

**Anne Frank** on self-awareness and personal reflection:

“How noble and good everyone could be if, every evening before falling asleep, they were to recall to mind the events of the whole day and consider exactly what has been good and bad. Then, without realizing it, you try to improve yourself at the start of each new day; of course, you achieve quite a lot in the course of time.
