## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Scientist **Donella Meadows** on being proactive, yet positive:

“There is too much bad news to justify complacency. There is too much good news to justify despair.”

​II.

Writer and professor **Joseph Campbell** on loving your fate:

“Nietzsche was the one who did the job for me. At a certain moment in his life, the idea came to him of what he called “the love of your fate.”

Whatever your fate is, whatever the hell happens, you say, “This is what I need.” It may look like a wreck, but go at it as though it were an opportunity, a challenge. If you bring love to that moment — not discouragement — you will find the strength is there. Any disaster you can survive is an improvement in your character, your stature, and your life. What a privilege!

Then, when looking back at your life, you will see that the moments which seemed to be great failures followed by wreckage were the incidents that shaped the life you have now. The crisis throws you back, and when you are required to exhibit strength, it comes.”
