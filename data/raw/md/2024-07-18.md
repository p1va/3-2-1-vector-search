# 3-2-1: The key to great relationships, the will to achieve, and beauty as a guiding principle

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“When one worldview dominates your thinking, you'll try to explain every problem you face through that worldview. Read widely and realize there are many answers.”

​II.

“A great relationship is not only finding the person you have fun with, but also finding the person you want to be bored with. The beauty of long-term relationships is often hidden in boring, ordinary moments.”

III.

“Some projects benefit from early action. If you're writing a book, it's easy to spend a lot of time brainstorming titles and dreaming up an outline, but it's better to simply write. The book discovers itself as you go. Yes, you'll need to go back and organize things, but this is easier to do once you have material. The key is to act first and then organize your thinking.

Other projects benefit from early planning. The best way to build a skyscraper is to plan carefully. If you start placing steel beams on day one, you're guaranteed to run into problems. It is harder to make changes once you've begun. You'll need to tear it down and start over again. The key is to organize your thinking and then act.

Do you need early action or early planning?”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

A **Latin adage** on the will to achieve:

“If there is no wind, row.”

*Source: I'm told the original version was possibly written by Virgil as “Destitutus ventis, remos adhibere.”*

​II.

Investor and mathematician **Jim Simons** on beauty:

“Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. I think pretty much everything I've done has had an aesthetic component—at least to me. Now, you might think, “Building a company that's trading bonds? What's so aesthetic about that?” What's aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right. And if you feel that you're the first one to do it right, that's a terrific feeling. It's a beautiful thing to do something right.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It's important to have boundaries in life, but sometimes you may feel guilty for enforcing them. Aren't I supposed to be generous? Am I unkind if I say no to this?

The question isn't whether to be flexible or firm, but when to be each one. A good life has a healthy mix of selfish boundaries and unselfish giving. You don't have to be all things at all times. Sometimes you pour for others and sometimes you refill your own cup.

What does this moment call for?
